Cold air entering the interconnector tubes (whether for cooling or due to leakage) will cool the propagating flame and impair ignition propagation characteristics. However, without cooling air, the interconnector tubes may overheat, and if the tubes are too large, the downstream flow may be affected, leading to localized overheating of the flame tube. Therefore, extensive tuning was required to determine a satisfactory compromise for the interconnector tube area (see Sections 8 and 9 in Reference 2).

For small nozzles, a length-to-diameter ratio of 1:7 is satisfactory. For larger flow numbers and wider spray cone angles, a ratio of 1:10 should be used. For example, for a nozzle orifice diameter of 0.140 inches, the length should be 0.014 inches.",

Typically, 2–3 slots are used for flow numbers less than 1.0, and 6 slots for flow numbers greater than 3.0. \nNote: Swirl slot dimensions should not be too small to avoid clogging by solid particles in the fuel.

Figure 1b shows another nozzle structural form, where the orifice plate and plunger are inserted into the swirl sleeve. After assembling the three components, fuel can flow into the two swirl holes. Detailed structural features of this nozzle are shown in Figure 1c. Generally, fuel enters the swirl chamber through two holes of diameter p. The swirl chamber can be considered a very short cylinder with diameter D and length b, leading to a conical surface with a cone angle Φ. Inside the swirl chamber, fuel is sprayed out through the nozzle orifice of diameter d in a vortex form. The mechanism of this flow has been explained (Taylor, 1950)."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "When the nozzle is in good working condition, there is an air vortex at the center of the swirl, causing the fuel to exit the nozzle as a thin film with both axial and tangential velocities. Upon leaving the nozzle, the fuel disperses into a cone with angle θ. The surface gradually forms transverse waves and then breaks into oil filaments and droplets (Squire, 1953). If the fuel pressure drops excessively or the fuel viscosity increases too much, the surface tension acting on the cone can transform the oil cone into a tulip-like shape. In worse cases, the air vortex disappears, and the fuel sprays out from the nozzle orifice as one or several oil filaments, resulting in poor atomization quality."

By measuring the temperature, the viscosity and density of the fuel could be estimated based on pre-determined relationships between fuel viscosity, density, and temperature parameters. Thus, for each test, the following parameters were determined: Q (lb/hr), P (lb/in²), d (inches), ρ (g/cm³), and viscosity μ (centipoise). Although the units used were not consistent, these are the units commonly used by most people working with fuel nozzles in the UK. The values of \\( Q^2 / d^4 P \\rho \\) and \\( Q / \\mu d \\) for nozzles (2) to (7) were calculated and plotted. The data points for each nozzle closely aligned with a common curve.

Figure 4 shows ten such curves plotted on logarithmic coordinates for d values ranging from 0.010 to 0.100 inches. These curves allow the determination of the orifice diameter and other dimensions of a standard nozzle for a wide range of pressure, density, and viscosity conditions through interpolation. When the values of \\( Q^2 / P \\rho \\) and \\( Q / \\mu \\) exceed the range of the curves, the curves can be extended for applicability by dividing \\( Q / P \\rho \\) by \\( 10^{4m} \\) and \\( Q / \\mu \\) by \\( 10^m \\), while multiplying the d value by \\( 10^m \\) (where m is a positive number). Notably, for \\( Q / \\mu d \\) values around 1600 (in consistent units), there is a distinct change in the slope of the curves in Figures 3 and 4. As the \\( Q / \\mu d \\) value decreases, the nozzle tends to malfunction due to inadequate spray formation or poor atomization. Only when the μ value increases to about 30 centipoise does \\( Q / \\mu d \\) fall into the left region of the slope change. If both \\( Q / \\mu d \\) and μ are low, the nozzle fails to form a conical spray. For example, when μ is as low as 1 centipoise and \\( Q / \\mu d \\) is below 1600, the nozzle may not operate properly. There is no clear reason why the curves in Figure 4 cannot be extended to higher \\( Q / \\mu \\) values."

Similarly, Figure 9 shows the variation of fuel flow rate with tangential hole diameter, with the relationship being \\( Q \\propto p^{0.70} \\). If both the orifice diameter and tangential hole diameter vary simultaneously, it is expected that the flow rate Q will be proportional to the 1.64th power of d or p. Figure 5 confirms this result within experimental error. For standard nozzles, based on Figure 3, when the fuel supply pressure is 100 lb/in² and d, p, and D/7.5 are approximately 0.067 inches, \\( \\Delta Q \\propto d^{1.93} \\). Thus, the effect of changes in linear dimensions (which do not automatically change with orifice and tangential hole diameters) causes the fuel flow rate to vary proportionally to \\( L^{0.28} \\).

Therefore, the fuel flow rate can vary by a ratio related to the diameter ratio of the return oil hole S to the nozzle diameter d.

The experimental results were obtained within a pressure range of 6 to 125 psi and a flow number range of 0.5 to 4.15.

When there was no difference between the experimental conditions with the return oil passage open or closed, he found that the droplet diameter, where the surface area to volume ratio matches the corresponding value in the spray (this diameter is sometimes referred to as the Surface Mean Diameter, S.M.D.), conforms to the following relationship:"

Since Needham demonstrated that different shapes and flow numbers of Lucas nozzles fit Equation (4), it is reasonable to expect that jet engine nozzles with different flow numbers and shapes will fit Equation (5). There is no other data available on the droplet size of jet engine nozzles with the return oil hole closed. However, Joyce referenced three nozzles of nearly standard shape and orifice diameters of 0.036, 0.050, and 0.075 inches (referred to here as Nozzles B, C, and D, respectively) and obtained six measurements. Using Equation (5) to calculate the S.M.D. with the return oil passage closed, the ratio of S.M.D. with the return oil passage open to that with it closed can be determined, and their relationship with the corresponding fuel flow rate ratio (with the return oil passage open to closed) can be plotted. This is shown in Figure 15. The fact that these points closely align with the curve indicates that the S.M.D. of return-flow nozzles can be reliably calculated using Equation (5) and the curve in Figure 15. Nevertheless, further experiments with more nozzles are still desirable. According to curves published by Joyce (1949), the S.M.D. of centrifugal nozzles increases slightly with viscosity, approximately proportional to the 0.2 power of the kinematic viscosity."

Further research on the effect of combustion chamber air pressure on fuel atomization quality and the atomization quality of return-flow nozzles (especially for fuels with relatively high viscosity) would be valuable."

The flame stabilizers were designed based on test rig results (see Reference [1]), and thus there was no prior engine operational experience to verify the performance characteristics or mechanical reliability of the stabilizers.

Consequently, much of the development work focused on finding methods to avoid the 'buzz' condition and achieve satisfactory performance."

Rig tests with segmented flame stabilizer components showed that fuel overflowed forward from the inlet and immediately created a fuel-rich zone behind the stabilizer at the inlet (see Figure 2). It was believed that the resulting intense flame could induce instability and potential local rich blowout, acting as a source of pressure fluctuations. This issue was resolved by increasing the outlet hole diameter of the distribution tubes to prevent forward overflow (see Reference [3]). The resulting flame was significantly improved, but engine tests showed no noticeable improvement in the 'buzz' limit."

Simultaneously, the required pilot fuel flow for optimal ignition characteristics was determined. To address the filling time and flame propagation issues in vaporizing stabilizers, it was found that the required pre-metered flow was higher than what was needed for basic stability requirements (see References [4], [5], [6]). Thus, a compromise was necessary to determine the pre-metered wake fuel flow value that provided both good ignition performance and high-altitude stability."

It was believed that the simple straight-shot nozzles of the main afterburner fuel manifold incorrectly introduced fuel between stabilizers, contaminating the pilot fuel and causing premature local rich blowout in the wake of the flame stabilizers. Initially, the outer fuel manifold was positioned far upstream of the outer flame stabilizer. To prevent fuel from entering the heat shield annular cavity, a long fuel shield extending upstream of the manifold was installed. One of the initial improvements involved removing the spray bars from the No. 4 manifold and moving the manifold closer to the outer flame stabilizer (see Figure 3). This arrangement reduced the need for the fuel shield, which was subsequently removed, resulting in reduced cold pressure loss and system weight. Combustion stability also improved, equivalent to allowing a 2 psi reduction in afterburner pressure (see Reference [7])."

Further improvements included moving all manifolds 4 inches downstream, moving the intermediate (No. 2) flame stabilizer 9 inches downstream, removing the spray bars from the innermost intermediate (No. 2) manifold, and changing the spray angle and pitch circle diameter of the outer (No. 4) manifold.

This was necessary because 'buzz' was encountered even at relatively low afterburner ratios. It was hypothesized that the blockage effect of the catalytic igniter caused a redistribution of airflow in the center of the combustion chamber, leading to locally over-rich fuel zones. Shutting off the inner manifold increased the afterburner ratio limited by 'buzz,' but this also caused high-frequency (2 kHz) oscillations known as 'screech,' resulting in mechanical damage. Tests were conducted with a reduced inner manifold flow rate (flow number = 8) as a temporary standard for the afterburner, achieving the desired 'buzz'-free performance while minimizing the tendency to produce 'screech' across most of the flight envelope. However, performance was still insufficient at the guarantee point of 36,000 feet altitude and Mach 2.0, requiring the inner manifold to be completely shut off. To address the 'screech' issue, holes were drilled in the first three segments of the heat shield (see Reference [8])."

However, non-afterburning engine performance tests showed that a 185 in² mixer provided better specific fuel consumption and higher non-afterburning thrust. Various tests were conducted to achieve velocity and temperature fields in the afterburner combustion chamber similar to those produced by the 210 in² mixer while maintaining compatibility with the 185 in² mixer. These tests were insufficient to conclude whether changing the mixer was appropriate. All such work was conducted on sea-level test stands, with high-altitude performance derived only from tests with bleed air from the 12th stage. The 185 in² mixer never underwent comprehensive comparative high-altitude engine tests."

This was the result obtained with the 210 in² funnel mixer. The rationale was that matching fuel distribution with airflow was simpler using annular fuel manifolds. Additionally, circumferential variations in distribution could rotate to different positions under various flight conditions. Thus, even if the match was good in one condition, it could be completely mismatched in another. The 185 in² mixer indeed produced more pronounced undesirable distributions compared to the 210 in² mixer."

Further increases in fuel flow led to a drop in combustion efficiency, thereby defining the maximum afterburner limit. A more practical improvement involved removing the funnels from 10 of the Spey funnel mixers. Despite encountering 'buzz' limitations, performance improved significantly due to a more uniform circumferential distribution compared to the 210 in² funnel mixer. However, unlike the annular mixer, the temperature and mass flow rate per unit area radial distributions were relatively smooth with this mixer. Both the slotted and annular mixers exhibited differences from the ideal distribution due to sensitivity to bypass ratio."

Thus, in addition to improved afterburner performance, non-afterburning engine performance, specific fuel consumption, and thrust also benefited.

The reduction in the ignition limit is due to various reasons, primarily the predefined fuel supply schedule for the catalytic igniter and flame propagation issues.

The temperature \\( T_6 \\) was adjusted to its specified value using the maximum temperature controller, while \\( T_1 \\) was allowed to stabilize at 150°C. The afterburner was then ignited using a catalytic igniter installed on the tail cone of the simulation device, with only the vaporizer stabilizer supplied with fuel. Subsequently, the main afterburner fuel flow was increased via the segmented valves to the maximum predetermined fuel flow for the specific altitude. At this point, the automatic data recording system scanned and recorded the primary parameters. If the parameters determining the afterburner Mach number, \\( \frac{M \\sqrt{T}}{S503} \\), and bypass ratio were within the limits specified in Table II, the parameters were recorded, and a set of readings was obtained. If combustion instability occurred before reaching the maximum predetermined main afterburner fuel flow, the fuel flow was reduced to just below the instability threshold, and readings were recorded. If no instability occurred at the maximum predetermined fuel flow, the fuel flow was increased by 15%, and the automatic data recording system scanned and recorded another set of readings. Whenever the nozzle reached its maximum open position (i.e., contacted the stop), the main afterburner fuel flow was no longer increased, and readings were recorded."

The main manifold fuel flow was then reduced until the \"buzz\" disappeared. The vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow was readjusted to achieve ±43% (±60 gallons/hour) of the standard fuel flow. The main manifold fuel flow was increased again using the normal method until the \"buzz\" boundary was reached.

Tests on a small-scale rig showed that this created a fuel-rich flame behind the intake nozzle, while the flame toward each end of the distribution tube became weaker. Tests on an open-ended rig also found that for low $C_D$ values, increasing the outlet area resulted in a relatively stable blue flame around the stabilizer.

The plot indicates that for these test configurations, the nozzle area (and thus the afterburner temperature) increases with increasing fuel flow, suggesting that combustion efficiency either increases or at least does not decrease with increasing fuel flow. The curves also show that for each configuration, as the restrictors change from Group 1 to Group 2 to Group 3, the nozzle area (and thus efficiency) tends to decrease. Unfortunately, this trend of decreasing nozzle area coincides with the trend of moving away from \"buzz\" as shown in previous plots, so it can be concluded that expanding the stable combustion boundary comes at the cost of some afterburner efficiency."

Attempts were made to ignite at minimum afterburner state by selecting vaporizer stabilizer fuel quantity. Although poor flame propagation was a major issue, ignition time significantly increased when vaporizer stabilizer flow was below nominal (214 gallons/hour). The inner-ring stabilizer ignited 2 seconds earlier than the second and third ring stabilizers. With nominal vaporizer stabilizer flow, ignition time was 2.5 seconds.

Even at nominal vaporizer stabilizer flow, flame propagation issues were encountered, with the inner two rows of vaporizer stabilizers igniting approximately 1.0-1.5 seconds earlier than the outer stabilizers. An overall vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow exceeding 180 gallons/hour was required for instantaneous flame propagation in the afterburner combustion chamber. Further increasing the vaporizer stabilizer flow reduced ignition time even more. A vaporizer stabilizer flow of 210 gallons/hour was considered the minimum allowable flow to achieve sufficiently fast afterburner ignition and flame propagation at this altitude, representing a 53.7% increase over the nominal flow. Further ignition tests were conducted with various fuel ring fuel flows (with constant venturi and stabilizer flows), showing that increasing fuel ring flow reduced ignition time. Due to limitations in the auxiliary fuel supply, the flow could not exceed 40 gallons/hour. Increasing the venturi fuel flow to 0.00052 lb/sec had no significant effect except for increasing the afterburner ignition time to 1.25 seconds at the recommended higher stabilizer flow (with a flow of 0.00013 lb/sec).",

Increasing the total vaporizer stabilizer flow to 150 gallons/hour improved overall afterburner ignition time, reducing it from 6-8 seconds to 2 seconds, although the outer-ring vaporizer stabilizer still ignited 1 second later than the inner two rings. Almost simultaneous flame propagation was achieved at 170 gallons/hour, representing an 84% increase over the nominal flow.

At these altitudes, ignition time remained long due to poor flame propagation in the evaporative stabilizer.",
        "Increasing the evaporative stabilizer fuel supply by 60 gallons/hour resulted in nearly instantaneous flame propagation within the combustion chamber.",
        "These results further confirm the necessity of the two improvement measures for enhancing afterburner ignition as outlined in report DTR86020: increasing the fuel supply to the catalytic igniter's fuel ring to boost output energy and increasing the fuel supply to the evaporative stabilizer to accelerate flame propagation in the combustion chamber.",
        "Based on these tests, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that under high-altitude conditions, poor flame propagation in the combustion chamber with the early production type evaporative stabilizer fuel supply is determined by the fuel-filling characteristics of the evaporative stabilizer.",
        "As mentioned in report DTR86052, modifying the fuel distribution of the evaporative stabilizer can increase its fuel supply without deteriorating afterburner flameout performance.",
        "As confirmed by tests on engine 20003, the early production type afterburner flameout at Mn 0.9 occurred at 50,000 feet with an afterburner combustion chamber pressure of 7.2 psi (absolute). During tests on engine 43 last June, flameout occurred at a pressure of 5 psi (absolute), corresponding to Mn 0.9 and an altitude of 55,000 feet. This performance degradation is attributed to the reintroduction of fuel into the inner fuel manifold.",
        "Recommendations for the next high-altitude test bench trial include: (1) Improve the afterburner regulator to increase the evaporative stabilizer fuel supply by 60 gallons/hour across the entire operating range. (2) Adjust the distribution of the evaporative stabilizer fuel supply under a total test bench flow number of 32. (3) Improve the catalytic ignition system based on current high-altitude test bench results."

At Mach 2.0, the fuel supply increases significantly, which positively impacts ignition at this Mach number.

This explains the inconsistency in previous high-altitude afterburner ignition test results, where better results were consistently obtained at Mach 2.0. Since the reserve engines operate at \\( P_1 \\) below 5 psi (absolute), ignition tests were previously conducted at Mach 2.0."

This may be due to the resupply of the inner fuel ring. It is reasonable to consider the influence of fuel concentration at the center of the combustion chamber and to avoid burning the stabilizer of the catalytic igniter by directing the spray toward the edge of the inner ring evaporative stabilizer. If the afterburner can be ignited at high altitudes using a larger fuel supply from the catalytic igniter fuel ring, it could reduce the load on the inner ring evaporative stabilizer and further compensate for the fuel supply to the inner fuel ring. The effect of the inner fuel ring's fuel supply on flameout will be verified in future high-altitude test rig trials."

Figure 1 illustrates some afterburning ratio values derived from standard combustion chamber tests, highlighting the degree of scatter. Thus, the only method to obtain the afterburning ratio is through estimation, using the nozzle position indicator readings and the theoretical relationship between the afterburning ratio and the change in effective area from non-afterburning to afterburning states. In high-altitude test beds, engine thrust measurements are highly reliable. Based on experience with the Spey 37 engine, the afterburning ratio can be determined simultaneously by thrust and nozzle position indicators, with the latter method proving highly satisfactory. This lends greater reliability to using the nozzle position indicator method for determining the afterburning ratio in setup tests."

During standard combustion chamber tests, until duct damage occurred, \\( S14 / P_i \\) varied by +2.5% (see Figure 7), and S503 varied by +4.25% (equivalent to two-thirds of the high working line corresponding value). After duct repair, the low working line calibration showed a -0.25% change in the \\( S503 - P \\) relationship, as shown in Figure 8. This change in S503 is likely a calibration shift due to repositioning of the S503 probe mounting during duct repair, rather than a significant change in the afterburner chamber state. With sufficient data to verify that the setup was adjusted to the non-afterburning calibration state, the setup should have the correct inlet state for the afterburner chamber."

It was hypothesized that reducing the pitch circle diameter of the outer spray bar orifices on the No. 3 fuel manifold could improve lateral fuel distribution. Comparison with the unstable combustion boundary indicated an improvement in the stable combustion boundary, as shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6. Removing the fuel shield slightly reduced the afterburning ratio (by approximately 2%) but improved high-altitude stability, allowing the afterburner chamber to operate stably at a total pressure drop of 2 psi lower, achieving the design total pressure of 5 psi for the afterburner chamber. This was compared to the standard fuel distribution using three manifolds. All subsequent tests were conducted without the fuel shield. It should be noted that after removing the fuel shield, the outer fuel manifold was moved downstream to the plane of the heat shield edge to prevent fuel from falling behind the shield."

Figures 4 and 9 show that the \\( X_D / p_0 \\) points align well, but \\( X_L / p_0 \\) exhibits significant scatter, which is also reflected in the \\( \\Delta X_G / p_0 \\) values. Due to this scatter, the test results were analyzed using average lines drawn through these scattered points. These average lines indicate discrepancies between theory and test results, believed to be due to omitted terms. The scatter around the average line reflects inaccuracies in net thrust measurement."

This system could reliably ignite at a Mach number of 0.9 and an altitude of 40,000 feet using AVTUR fuel, and at 32,000 feet using AVTAG fuel. To improve the fuel filling time, which was considered to occupy a significant portion of the ignition time, the hole size in the catalytic fuel distribution ring was increased from 0.039 inches to 0.046 inches, and a 120 psi check valve was installed. This check valve provided an additional 80 psi fuel pressure at the catalytic igniter inlet for given pump pressure and altitude conditions. The 0.025-inch Venturi restrictor was replaced with a 7 × 0.035-inch damper, which had the same flow coefficient in cold tests, to prevent blockage from gum deposits caused by fuel boiling. For a given pump pressure, increasing the afterburner strut restrictor to 0.040 inches increased flow and reduced fuel filling time."

However, the difference in ignition times between AVTUR and AVTAG varies among configurations, indicating that both fuels should be tested for each specific configuration to properly evaluate performance. The increase in ignition time is likely due to fuel boiling and vaporization, with AVTAG being a more volatile fuel. Fuel boiling and vaporization reduce flow within the catalytic igniter and cause vapor lock and Venturi blockage in the cone fuel manifold."

With the optimal R1 restrictor, the production-type fuel manifold reduces ignition time by approximately 0.5 seconds compared to the early-production type. AVTAG fuel tests showed a similar trend, with ignition time reduced by approximately 0.75 seconds. This improvement is likely due to a better \"match\" achieved by readjusting the fuel ratio between the Venturi and fuel manifold. It is possible that the increased orifice size is not yet optimal. Further tests confirmed that increasing the fuel manifold orifice size to further reduce the Venturi fuel ratio is appropriate."

These curves are essentially independent of fuel type, fuel manifold, afterburner strut restrictor, and Venturi restrictor sizes. However, AVTAG fuel slightly lowers the rich limit. Near the rich limit, ignition time increases, similar to when chamber pressure is reduced. Special fuel flow variation curves for specified afterburner strut restrictors are overlaid on this graph. It is observed that higher ignition altitudes (lower pressure) require smaller restrictor sizes. Figure 5 fully illustrates this point. However, reducing restrictor size to facilitate high-altitude ignition increases ignition time at higher afterburner pressures, as the predetermined fuel flow shifts toward the lean limit of the catalytic igniter. Thus, the optimal restrictor size for high-altitude conditions is smaller than that for sea-level ignition. For a 7 psi (absolute) ignition limit, the required afterburner strut restrictor size is approximately 0.043 inches, regardless of Venturi restrictor size."

For a true comparison at a given engine condition (fixed upstream fuel pressure), approximately 80 psi should be subtracted from the 120 psi check valve line. Thus, a 125 psi S635 line with a 200 psi check valve should be compared to a 200 psi S635 line with a 120 psi check valve. It is evident that the 120 psi check valve is superior in two aspects:"

The impact on combustion efficiency is less certain because reduced velocity improves efficiency, but greater flame extension distance may reduce it. The net result is that efficiency is not significantly affected, but each case must be evaluated for its pros and cons. Additionally, weight must be considered, as the afterburner system weight is a function of the diameter squared."

Beyond a certain blockage ratio, stability begins to decrease, as demonstrated in Figure 17. This figure shows the variation of the stability parameter with blockage ratio for various inlet Mach numbers of the afterburner. It illustrates that the optimal blockage ratio depends on the inlet Mach number and confirms the significant impact of Mach number (afterburner diameter) on stability, as mentioned in Section 4.6.2."

Consequently, the catalytic igniter must ignite the afterburner fuel within 3 seconds of afterburner activation. Fuel is supplied via a check valve, with a bypass oil hole on the valve allowing the working fuel line downstream (inside the afterburner) to connect to an external flushing line during non-afterburning operation. The total fuel flow to the catalytic igniter is regulated by a restrictor at the inlet of the fuel supply line, where the fuel is entirely in liquid form. After passing through the restrictor, the flow is divided between the Venturi nozzle and the tail cone fuel distribution ring. The required nozzle fuel flow rate is very small (measured as low as 0.0002 lb/s to achieve maximum catalytic assembly heat release). At such low flow rates, the fuel in the pipeline vaporizes, making the system particularly sensitive to the fuel's volatility characteristics. The flow rate with AVTAG fuel differs from that with AVTUR fuel. The system is adjusted to favor the most commonly used AVTUR fuel; if AVTAG fuel is used, performance may degrade."

In practice, data confirming the upper portion of the experimental curve is limited, and it can be considered that the experimental and theoretical predictions are essentially consistent. The predetermined fuel supply for the Spey MK202 engine's catalytic igniter lies within the stability boundary, and ignition has been proven possible with AVTUR or AVCAT fuel up to 7 lb/in (absolute). Although the total predetermined fuel flow rate is the same when using AVTAG fuel, differences in volatility, as previously mentioned, cause the catalytic assembly to fail at approximately 14 lb/in² (absolute)."

Thus, in Figure 2, Manifold 1 is placed at the center of area \\\\(\\mathrm{A}_1\\\\), Manifold 2 at the center of \\\\(\\mathrm{A}_{12}\\\\), and so on. Here, it is assumed that the manifolds and stabilizers are coplanar. The designer can then check the manifold positions to determine if multiple manifold rings are needed in each annular passage. For example, in the Spey afterburning system, using a single manifold ring in areas \\\\(\\mathrm{A}_{12}\\\\) and \\\\(\\mathrm{A}_{23}\\\\) would result in a radial distance exceeding 5 inches. If a 5-inch circumferential spacing is used to determine the number and diameter of nozzles, the nozzle hole diameter would exceed the maximum allowable diameter (approximately 0.084 inches). Therefore, in such cases, multiple manifold rings must be used to reduce the hole spacing. In the Spey engine, this is achieved by installing fuel rods on the positioned manifolds. Strictly speaking, these fuel rods should have different lengths on the inner and outer sides to spray fuel toward the area center between the manifold and the V-gutter centerline. However, for manufacturing convenience, the fuel rods on the Spey manifold are made equal in length."

The greater the distance, the better the fuel preparation and the more uniform the distribution.

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Afterburning systems designed before 1960 used planar V-gutters as flame stabilizers, relying on upstream fuel manifolds to inject part of the fuel into the gutter wake region. Igniting this portion of fuel establishes a flame, which then propagates to the remaining fuel. Since this afterburning system is nearly a premixed system, the ignition limits of kerosene regrettably restrict the fuel-air ratio to no less than 0.03 for ignition. This fuel-air ratio corresponds to 30% of the afterburning ratio for a full afterburning turbofan engine."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "During the ignition of a turbofan engine, pressure fluctuations in the afterburner can adversely affect the operation of the low-pressure compressor. Indeed, if excessive pressure changes occur, the engine may surge. Modern afterburning engines with low compressor surge margins avoid surging by designing the afterburning system to prevent excessive pressure fluctuations during ignition. This is achieved by ensuring the tailpipe responds as quickly as possible and that the afterburning system can ignite at the minimum afterburning fuel flow (i.e., low afterburning ratio). In V-gutter flame stabilizer systems, a method called zonal fuel supply can reduce the minimum usable afterburning ratio to below 30%. This method involves sequentially cutting off fuel supply from the outer manifolds until only the inner manifold supplies fuel, as shown in Appendix Figure 1. This allows for a low afterburning ratio but has two drawbacks: first, the afterburning thrust varies in a stepwise manner with fuel flow, as shown in Figure 2, with each step corresponding to a change in the number of fuel-supplying manifolds; second, the propulsion efficiency is low, meaning a significant thrust loss, as detailed in Appendix 1 of this report. In this context, propulsion efficiency is defined as the ratio of the fuel required to produce a given thrust with a uniform temperature at the nozzle to the fuel required to produce the same thrust with a non-uniform temperature distribution."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Consequently, an alternative system was designed and implemented, where fuel is locally supplied within the flame stabilizer, employing what is known as an evaporative gutter stabilizer."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The fuel supplied to the stabilizer ensures that the flame stabilizer operates near the chemically correct fuel-air ratio across the entire flight envelope. When only this portion of fuel is supplied, a small afterburning ratio of nearly 10% can be achieved, with high combustion efficiency due to the fuel-air ratio being close to the chemically correct value. Additionally, since combustion occurs across the entire cross-section of the afterburner, propulsion efficiency is also high. Using this method, temperature increases can be below 100‰ while maintaining good stability and high combustion efficiency."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Thrust augmentation is achieved by injecting fuel into the airflow between the upstream fuel manifolds and the flame stabilizer, as shown in Figure 3(a). This fuel can be gradually increased to allow completely smooth thrust adjustment up to the maximum achievable thrust, as shown in Figure 3(b). As long as the main afterburning fuel—referred to as primary afterburning fuel—does not enter the wake region of the flame stabilizer, the system's stability is not affected by the magnitude of the afterburning ratio."

Numerous pairs of small holes in the distribution pipes allow the fuel-air mixture to flow along the pipes into the stabilizer. The slots on the stabilizer's back, aligned with the small holes in the distribution pipes, serve three purposes: further atomizing the fuel with the main airflow, cooling the stabilizer walls, and enhancing the recirculation zone of the stabilizer."

Unlike fixed-displacement pumps (such as gear pumps), it does not require a valve to spill excess fuel back to the low-pressure side. Because it uses a variable-stroke pump, the fuel heating caused by the recirculation of large amounts of fuel during high-altitude idle flight conditions can be kept to a minimum. Another major advantage is its minimal leakage, allowing the pump to provide higher output pressure. This ensures better fuel atomization during engine ignition, even at very low pump speeds."

The Spey MK202 engine's high-pressure fuel pump is driven by the high-speed gearbox through an appropriate gear train at 0.2318 times the high-pressure rotor speed. The plungers are axially positioned within the rotor and reciprocate as they rotate around the swashplate. By changing the angle of the swashplate, the pump's stroke can be adjusted. The swashplate is controlled by the force of a servo piston with unequal areas, which opposes the spring force. The servo piston senses changes in the fuel pressure difference between the fuel regulator (C.A.S.C) and the low-pressure shaft limiter. In practice, the stroke of the high-pressure fuel pump is adjusted to maintain a balance between the pump force, the force generated by the pressure difference on both sides of the servo piston, and the spring force."

This is approximate and assumes full stroke is reached at \\( P_p = 1900 \\) psi, meaning the pump pressure \\( P_p \\) only increases with flow, thus increasing the pump stroke. When afterburner is engaged, the servo pressure differential may tend to fall below the indicated characteristic, depending on aircraft flight conditions and engine speed. In any case, exceeding the indicated characteristic is unlikely."

This variation is complex, making it difficult for a control system that reflects only a single parameter (such as the old air-fuel ratio type operating on compressor outlet pressure) to provide a satisfactory acceleration program. In fact, studies of engine characteristics near the stall boundary using well-known dimensionless analysis methods show that to compensate accurately for changes in operating conditions, the acceleration fuel flow program must respond to three parameters. The same analysis indicates that when fuel flow and operating conditions are expressed in dimensionless form, the relationship \\(\\left(\frac{F},{P_2 \\sqrt{T_2}} \\sim \frac{N_H},{\\sqrt{T_2}}\right)\\) can be described by a single curve. This directly provides the basis for acceleration control. Appendix 1 (Section 14) shows that this can be achieved without measuring air temperature."

In the dimensionless analysis of compressor and engine characteristics, there is another parameter representing the effect of Reynolds number on the characteristics. However, experience shows that it is a secondary factor and can be neglected. Another influencing factor is the ram pressure ratio, which affects engine characteristics only within a small speed range and is not difficult to handle in practice. CASC is based on the principle of considering all factors except secondary ones and is implemented in a very simple manner, achieving an unusually satisfactory compromise between control precision and device simplicity and reliability."

For the first two requirements, a proportional regulator is appropriate and has the advantage of being mechanically very simple. However, it inherently exhibits speed droop, which, if uncorrected, can cause significant speed errors. Fortunately, CASC can combine the speed regulator with the acceleration controller. The altitude and speed parameters used in acceleration control also automatically and accurately provide a reference readjustment for the speed regulator. Thus, the transient speed droop required for stability is retained, but no drift in the regulated steady-state speed occurs when environmental conditions change."

The high-pressure pump servo piston senses the oil pressure after the low-pressure spool regulator on one side and the high-pressure pump outlet oil pressure on the other.

The regulator spring force is reduced, and the regulator moves in the direction of closing the VMO gap under the greater flyweight force. To prevent the gap from completely closing and causing flameout, this movement must be limited. The minimum VMO gap width achieved provides a deceleration control (DCU) that is a fixed proportion of the acceleration curve, resulting in a dimensionless deceleration control below the steady-state operating line."

In this case, the engine idle speed is required to increase with altitude to provide sufficient air for aircraft equipment and cabin pressurization and to allow rapid acceleration at any altitude. In the CASC system, this requirement is easily met by setting up a small bypass hole in parallel with the VMO. The flow characteristic number of this hole is approximately 6.5 and can be adjusted via a needle valve, but it cannot be reduced further when set to the minimum flow area. When the throttle lever is pulled back to the minimum (idle) position, the resulting combined flow increases its influence with altitude. During aircraft climb, the engine fuel flow required to maintain a given speed becomes smaller, and as the engine speed gradually increases, the engine fuel demand curve intersects the modified deceleration control characteristic line, achieving an elevated idle speed. Only at low altitudes does the speed regulator control the engine idle speed to a sufficiently low level."

When \\(T_6\\) or \\(T_3\\) reaches the limit value, the signal from the amplifier is sent to a servo motor, which moves to change the lever ratio and reduce the regulator spring load. This adjusts the fuel flow and overrides the pilot's throttle lever input.

If such shutdown is not permissible, the CASC device can be recalibrated to operate at higher altitudes. However, this would reduce the low-altitude idle speed and fuel flow, thereby increasing engine oil temperature, which is already at its limit under these conditions. Recent tests, however, indicate that the engine is more sensitive to Reynolds number effects than assumed in the brochure, which also reduces high-altitude idle speed. Thus, the flight envelope limitations are not as stringent as indicated in this report."

The foundation of this method involves hypothesizing an idle speed and calculating the required fuel flow for the engine at this speed from booklet curves. Then, the total fuel flow supplied by the control system to the main and secondary nozzles is estimated. If the supplied and required flows are not equal, the engine speed is re-hypothesized until they match. Under certain flight conditions, if fuel is supplied only through the secondary nozzle, it is necessary to compare whether the estimated fuel flow through the secondary nozzle exceeds the calculated flow through both the main and secondary nozzles. If it does, the idle speed must be re-hypothesized until the required engine flow matches the flow supplied only through the secondary nozzle."

This is fundamentally achieved in the controller by selecting the material of the pressure differential piston flyweights, which is closely related to fuel density. Thus, changes in fuel density cause an inverse change in the \"apparent density\" of the flyweights, resulting in a corresponding change in the centrifugal force balancing the VMO pressure differential."

When the steady-state operation requirements are met in this way, the slot width changes only slightly in the high engine speed range. The force generated by the regulator spring is almost entirely dependent on the throttle lever position. Thus, the balancing force provided by the regulator flyweights also corresponds to the throttle lever position. Therefore, regardless of inlet conditions, for each throttle lever position, there is an almost constant high-pressure shaft speed, effectively providing constant speed regulation.

If the T₈ signal exceeds the standard voltage, the resulting error is amplified to drive the CACS T₆ adjustment control rack towards the maximum adjustment stop (reducing N_H). The drive current remains on the motor control phase, causing the motor to continue rotating until T₈ equals the standard voltage, at which point the error disappears, the control current drops to zero, the motor stops, and the system reaches equilibrium. Any attempt to further increase the engine T₆ will result in additional adjustment. Since the system is a 'zero-balance' type with stepless adjustment, regardless of the adjustment amount, the temperature will eventually stabilize at one value until the maximum adjustment stop is reached. Due to the slow action of the CACS T₈ control, a phase-lead circuit must be introduced. This circuit directly applies the maximum motor rotation voltage when the T₆ increase or decay rate exceeds 70-100°C/second."

When air passes through the boundary layer control sensing device to the CASC system to re-adjust the acceleration control unit (ACU), the boundary layer control re-adjustment pressure switch contacts close. The closed switch contacts activate the re-adjustment circuit, and the system re-adjusts to the 7-stage boundary layer control value.

The roller moves along a fixed track on a plane perpendicular to the regulator spring axis. When the speed selection lever cam is at a sufficiently high lift, the main lever 'B' will tilt towards the temperature adjustment roller, and the roller's movement will force the main lever to rotate around the speed selection lever cam, thereby increasing or decreasing the regulator spring setting. When the lift of the speed selection lever cam is reduced, the effect of the adjustment roller 'C' is diminished until the speed selection lever cam reaches the minimum lift position, where lever 'B' becomes parallel to the fixed track and no adjustment occurs at any point."

In the open position, both main and secondary fuel flows to the nozzles pass through the shutoff valve. In the closed position, the slide valve or plunger cuts off fuel supply to the main and secondary nozzles; simultaneously, the two high-pressure fuel inlet channels and the high-pressure fuel pump servo oil circuit are connected to the low-pressure fuel outlet. The high-pressure fuel pump servo piston senses low pressure, and the pump immediately moves to the minimum stroke position.

The servo piston then moves upward to the stop point. The movement of the servo piston allows servo fuel beneath the main piston to flow into low pressure. At this time, a high-pressure differential across the control restrictor causes the main piston to move to the maximum overflow position, occurring approximately 0.05 seconds after the start of the afterburner activation sequence. Both the overflow valve servo piston and main piston remain in the maximum overflow position until the catalytic timer inlet closes."

      "content": "Approximately 3.0 to 3.2 seconds after afterburner activation, the catalytic timer inlet closes, cutting off the servo high-pressure fuel source to the servo piston, reducing the servo piston pressure to low. Subsequently, the servo piston returns to its non-ignition position, once again cutting off the servo fuel leakage to low pressure beneath the main piston. The servo pressure beneath the main piston then begins to rise, causing the main piston to move toward the maximum non-overflow position. During this period, the speed of the main piston movement depends on the rate of pressure increase beneath it. Typically, with a main piston servo pressure of 860 psi (gauge) and low pressure of 40 psi (gauge), the output flow rate increases linearly from zero to maximum within 1.4 to 1.6 seconds, determined by the size of the control restrictor. After 1.4 to 1.6 seconds from the opening of the overflow valve, the valve is in the non-overflow position. Even if afterburner activation is disengaged, the valve remains in this position until the next afterburner activation."

This signal should relate to the error in P₆, which is the difference between the actual P₆ and the desired P₆ for a given P₃/P₂ (engine condition). This is because the nozzle hydraulic pump acts as an integrator and incorporates the signal from the pressure ratio regulator. In steady-state, a fixed signal value is required to ensure the nozzle hydraulic pump flow exactly compensates for leakage and cooling of the nozzle actuator. This fixed steady-state control position is called the null position."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Following conventional practice, the system uses direct-acting pressure to drive a rotary piston, providing a signal for simplicity and reliability. The rotary piston eliminates hysteresis caused by static friction in stationary pistons. On one side of the P₃/P₆ piston, the actual P₆ acts, while on the other side, the designed P₆ acts, with both sides having equal areas. The designed P₈ is a partial pressure between P₃ and P₀, and the areas of two orifices in the system are variable. The area of the P₃/P₈ orifice is changed by the movement of a needle valve integrated with the piston. In steady-state, the pressure ratio regulator signal piston remains in a fixed position, so the corresponding orifice area is also fixed. Since the pressure ratios P₈/P₀ and P₃/P₆ both exceed choking values, the airflow is continuous and considered isothermal, making the upstream pressures equal to the ratio of the corresponding orifice areas. When the downstream P₃/P₆ orifice is fixed in steady-state, selecting the upstream orifice's fine-tuning area allows us to obtain the correct P₈ value. Thus, a single-value relationship exists between P₃/P₂ and P₃/P₆, and the pressure ratio regulator generates a signal linearly related to P₃/P₂ (see TPR7789). This signal can be used to adjust the fine-tuning needle valve in the orifice, achieving the necessary P₆ at a given P₃/P₂ in steady-state. In practice, there are two P₃ fine-tuning needle valves: one for normal engine operation and another for boundary layer control activation. The use of boundary layer control alters the main engine operating line, thus changing the relationship between P₃/P₂ and the required P₃/P₆. The P₃ signal supplied to the fine-tuning needle valve is regulated by the boundary layer control switching valve. Therefore, in flight conditions, the fine-tuning needle valve adjusts the upstream orifice area, creating the main reference pressure P₆ on one side of the pressure ratio regulator piston. If the actual P₆ differs from the reference P₆, the piston moves, changing the needle valve position and thus the downstream orifice area. The needle valve's shape allows the system to adjust stably, moving the piston to a position away from the null. The piston displacement depends on the needle valve profile and the pressure difference on both sides of the piston. The displacement of a given needle valve profile becomes a measure of the pressure difference or the difference between actual P₀ and reference P₆."

      "content": "The piston's movement adjusts the swashplate angle of the nozzle oil pump, driving the exhaust nozzle to bring the actual \\( P_8 \\) closer to the reference \\( P_6 \\). During this adjustment process, the pressure on both sides of the piston reverses, moving the piston to balance the pressure, and the downstream orifice area is again used as the controller. This returns the nozzle oil pump stroke to the zero position, slowing the rate of change of the nozzle area. The system then moves toward a steady-state position until it stabilizes at the zero position."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "As described above, the profile of the needle valve significantly impacts the system's operation. For example, a needle valve with a very small taper produces an extremely fast system response. A small-taper needle valve requires a large displacement to change the orifice area sufficiently to balance any pressure difference on both sides of the piston. This pushes the oil pump to a large stroke position far from the zero point and rapidly moves the actuator. However, there is a time lag between the change in \\( P_8 \\) and the pressure from the pressure ratio regulator (actual \\( P_6 \\) to the piston). If the response time does not coordinate with the lag, it may cause nozzle instability. On the other hand, a large-taper needle valve can achieve the required change in the oil pump swashplate angle with small displacements, avoiding stability issues. However, these small changes result in minor variations in oil flow, leading to a slow system response, which is unacceptable for systems requiring rapid tracking of fuel flow changes. Therefore, the focus of this document is to find a compromise between these two extremes."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Another factor affecting nozzle instability is the static friction present in the nozzle oil actuator and the piston of the pressure ratio regulator. These forces have been minimized as much as possible. The static friction in the pressure ratio regulator piston arises from the sealing device rotating with the piston. Fixing this sealing device effectively eliminates this source of static friction. Thus, design efforts are required to reduce static friction in the oil actuator. Clearly, addressing side loads should be a priority in the initial design phase, as resolving this effectively reduces static friction."

The needle valve has a very small taper, with a gain of approximately 0.9 inches per turbine pressure ratio (the evolution of the needle valve profile is shown in Figure 1). The needle valve profile design provides a linear relationship between needle valve displacement and orifice area, making \\( P_3 / P_6 \\) and needle valve displacement approximately linear. The small taper profile yields a very fast time response but leads to system instability. Numerous needle valves with different tapers have been tested, each demonstrating a clear linear relationship between \\( P_3 / P_8 \\) and needle valve displacement. The primary limitation for slow nozzle movement is the rate of change in afterburner fuel flow. It has been found that a needle valve with a gain of 0.208 inches per turbine pressure ratio provides the slowest acceptable nozzle response for the fuel system. This needle valve offers a compromise between slow responses that may cause surge and fast responses that lead to instability, though it is not entirely satisfactory."

To this end, a small-taper profile with a gain of approximately 0.5 inches per pressure ratio replaced the closing taper profile beyond the 0.425 pressure ratio limit. This profile is currently in use, allowing fault-free operation in both the nozzle opening and closing directions."

The actual length of the entire regulating profile segment is only 0.125 inches, so gain variations along this segment can be neglected. It has been confirmed that these small changes are negligible in operation. This type of needle valve profile is acceptable and is currently in use."

      "content": "Afterburning is a convenient method for obtaining short-term thrust increases in situations such as takeoff, climb, or high-speed aircraft maneuvers. The primary disadvantage of this system is that, compared to other methods of achieving the same thrust increase, the specific fuel consumption rate during afterburning is higher, and the system itself is bulky. To increase thrust, larger engines with greater weight and frontal area are typically required. The advantage of using an afterburner is that it provides a high-speed exhaust jet for supersonic flight. To achieve high-speed airflow, the gas temperature must be raised to levels that the turbine cannot withstand. Afterburning is also affected by the combustion of fuel in the mixed internal and external flows downstream of the turbine. This combustion relies on unburned oxygen in the exhaust to sustain the flame. As detailed in TDR7789, for high-bypass-ratio engines with afterburners, precise fuel scheduling and a closed-loop exhaust nozzle control system are necessary to achieve the required accuracy and performance. In summary, due to pressure changes caused by fuel combustion in the exhaust nozzle, a nozzle area regulator is required. If the nozzle area is not adjustable, back pressure propagates through the bypass duct to the low-pressure compressor, affecting the engine's operating line. Therefore, a nozzle area regulator is needed to maintain the correct back pressure."

Such engines typically use afterburning only beyond the upper limit of the engine's operating range, where the compressor can be considered choked. At this point, there is a simple relationship between the compressor outlet pressure and the air mass flow through it. The fuel schedule can then be built around this parameter. However, in turbofan engines, the selection of basic parameters is more challenging. In this case, no single parameter can determine the air mass flow function. Since the core engine operates between choked states, the air mass flow through the core engine is easily determined. However, the air mass flow at the bypass duct outlet is not as easily determined and is unrelated to the parameters used to determine the core engine's air mass flow. A compromise can be found: under typical engine operating conditions, multiplying the core engine air mass flow by a coefficient approximates the total air mass flow. A correction coefficient is then used to account for variations in the bypass air mass flow. Finally, \\( P_3 \\) is taken as a measure of the core engine air mass flow and thus as the foundation for the entire control system."

Since a high bypass ratio has the same effect as a high \\( T_1 \\), a correction for \\( T_1 \\) is needed. However, \\( T_1 \\) itself is difficult to measure, especially during rapid transients, as thermocouples have a longer time constant compared to the engine system, increasing errors. Studying how errors affect the required fuel flow provides a clue to solving the problem. When the actual \\( T_1 \\) is higher (i.e., high bypass ratio), the air mass flow is greater than indicated by the \\( P_3 \\) signal, and the fuel-air ratio is lower. Thus, more fuel flow is needed. Conversely, when \\( T_1 \\) is low, the air mass flow is lower than indicated by \\( P_3 \\), requiring less fuel flow. We can derive a function of \\( N_H / \\sqrt{T_1} \\), but the measurement of \\( T_1 \\) remains problematic. Thus, \\( P_3 / P_2 \\) is taken as the correction function. When the high-pressure compressor is choked, \\( P_3 / P_2 \\) varies uniquely with \\( N_H / \\sqrt{T_1} \\). The function can thus be built around \\( P_3 / P_2 \\).

The choice of secondary pressure is resolved between \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_8 \\).

As the spool valve moves from one end of its stroke to the other, the opening of the VGFMV gradually increases. Therefore, since \\( P_b \\) has a single-valued relationship with the spool valve position, and the valve position determines the valve opening, this establishes a single-valued relationship between \\( P_b \\) and the valve opening.

This fuel flow is independent of the afterburner augmentation level. Thus, the valve size introduces a correction coefficient (a combination of constants), and the vaporizing gutter flow is independent of other variables. It should be noted that during engine operation, various spool valves are continuously rotating, which is a design feature of the spool valves to avoid friction hindering the spool valve's response to small changes in control pressure."

The Total Flow Metering Valve (TFMV) must account for both parameters. Again, fuel flows through the valve positioned by \\( P_b \\) and the pilot's throttle lever. The combined input command from \\( P_b \\) and the pilot's throttle lever is implemented by a spool valve connecting the VGFMV and TFMV, with a variable fulcrum on the pilot's afterburner selection lever. The VGFMV spool valve is positioned only by \\( P_b \\) (flight conditions), so this small shaft fulcrum acts as a variable fulcrum for the linkage. The fulcrum roller acts as a pivot within the linkage slot. The roller is actually positioned by the linkage from the pilot's afterburner selection lever. The TFMV spool valve is thus positioned by these two parameters. The positioning of the fulcrum roller is achieved by a signal from the pilot's lever, converted through a rack-and-pinion, cam, and follower into the position of a slider on the lever."

The Main Pressure Difference Regulator (MPDR) serves this function by controlling the pressure difference across the valve. The pressure balance of the total afterburner fuel pressure sets the MPDR regulator to adjust the rotary valve servo signal of the follow-up piston. This adjusts the afterburner fuel pump inlet throttle valve, thus supplying the required fuel flow while maintaining a constant pressure difference across the TFMV."

To address this issue, the Spey system employs a dual combustion system. One combustion system is the vaporizing gutter, which consumes approximately 10% of the maximum afterburner fuel flow under flight conditions. This fuel flow is effectively independent of the afterburner augmentation level. The vaporizing gutter flow passes through three concentric vaporizing gutters, providing a stable and nearly constant fuel combustion core. The remaining scheduled afterburner fuel flows through another fuel manifold system. Four concentric annular manifolds face the engine's vaporizing gutters, positioned between each vaporizing gutter. Catalytic igniters are located at the center of the vaporizing gutters. The innermost manifold is blocked to prevent fuel from that manifold from dripping onto the catalytic components, which could damage the catalytic igniter. Thus, although four manifolds are present in the current system, only the outermost three have fuel flowing through them. Fuel from the manifolds flows around the vaporizing gutters and is ignited. Since afterburner modulation affects only the fuel flow in the manifolds, the vaporizing gutter provides a stable combustion core, eliminating the risk of lean blowout. The fuel entering the respective combustion systems is scheduled for the vaporizing gutter by the VGFMV and for the entire system by the TFMV, with the difference being the scheduled fuel flow supplied to the manifolds."

      "content": "The requirement for the afterburner ignition timer is that the afterburner should activate 5 seconds after engagement. Before introducing main manifold fuel into the system, it is desirable to stabilize the system as much as possible to ensure the vapor gutter establishes the required stable fuel combustion core. However, the system has another limitation: the nozzle system must prevent fuel inflow to eliminate the possibility of surge. It has been demonstrated that the nozzle takes approximately 0.7 seconds to move from the pre-opened position to a stable afterburner position. As a design feature, it is preferable to introduce fuel only after twice the nozzle movement time, i.e., 1.4 seconds. Considering variations in devices, an additional 0.2-second tolerance is added."

      "content": "This leaves 3.4 seconds of the 5-second period. Assuming a minimum tolerance of 0.2 seconds, the time available for stabilizing vapor gutter fuel is between 3.0 and 3.2 seconds. Within this timeframe, the catalytic timer allows fuel to flow into the igniter, to the acceleration control spill valve, and to fill the afterburner fuel manifold. The size of the manifold filling orifice is determined based on the fuel quantity to be injected into the fuel manifold within the specified time under International Standard Atmosphere sea-level static conditions, normal weather, and takeoff state. Under other flight conditions, this flow rate may vary by approximately 30% above or below the actual filling amount, but such a shortcoming is permissible in the system."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "After 3 to 3.2 seconds, the catalytic timer cuts off fuel to the catalytic igniter, leaving only the vapor gutter to maintain ignition. Fuel filling also stops, and the signal fuel to the acceleration control spill valve ceases simultaneously. The pressure in the acceleration control spill valve servo piston drops to low pressure, and the servo piston returns to its non-afterburning position. Servo pressure builds up beneath the main piston, moving it to the maximum non-spill position. The speed at which the main piston moves determines the rate of fuel introduction into the fuel manifold, and the size of the control restrictor is set to meet the requirement based on a movement time of 1.4 to 1.6 seconds. Once the spill valve has fully moved to its non-spill position, the afterburner system begins operation. Thereafter, the acceleration and deceleration of afterburner fuel are controlled by limiting the servo fuel to the rotary valve."

      "content": "Afterburner disengagement is achieved by moving the throttle lever to the non-afterburning position. This actuates the spool valve in the afterburner selection valve, cutting off servo fuel to the nozzle actuator valve, rotary valve servo piston, and air purge selector valve. The actuator valve then closes, rapidly reducing the nozzle to its non-afterburning position. The signal to the air purge selector valve is removed, allowing the valve to return to its non-afterburning position, and purge air flows through the vapor gutter manifold to clear residual fuel in the system, preventing carbon buildup in the vapor gutter orifices. The removal of servo fuel to the rotary valve servo piston closes the low-pressure shutoff valve, preventing fuel from flowing through the vapor core pump to the scheduling system. Closing the low-pressure shutoff valve also cuts off servo fuel to the PRCU, leaving the nozzle controller uncontrolled by the PRCU. The engine then operates normally as a non-afterburning engine."

To address this, a nozzle control system is incorporated to restore the nozzle pressure to its value without afterburning, ensuring the core engine operates normally. This allows the core engine to remain independent of the afterburner in use, requiring no adjustments during afterburner operation. Given the need to regulate the exhaust area of the nozzle, this report details the current nozzle control system.

      "content": "To understand the selection of existing nozzle control systems, it is beneficial to first consider a simpler system for an engine with a lower compression ratio and no bypass (such as an engine without an external bypass system). The afterburning system of such an engine rarely encounters issues even at maximum afterburning conditions due to relatively low combustion temperatures. Since fuel combustion is well below the stoichiometric point under all flight conditions, the relationship between afterburning temperature changes and the percentage change in afterburner fuel flow is essentially linear. Therefore, a choice can be made between a system with scheduled fuel regulation in open-loop and sensed nozzle regulation in closed-loop, or another system with open-loop nozzle regulation and closed-loop fuel system regulation. Theoretically, the latter system is preferred based on response speed. When the fuel system is closed-loop, it is easier to avoid large transient errors between afterburner fuel flow and nozzle area. Typically, the response speed of the afterburner fuel system can be designed to be faster, allowing the fuel system to keep up with nozzle system adjustments."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "On the other hand, for systems requiring high afterburning ratios, fuel combustion tends toward the stoichiometric point. Under these conditions, if a closed-loop fuel system is chosen, it can be observed that similar levels of afterburning ratios can be achieved with fuel-air ratios just before or after the stoichiometric point. If the fuel-air ratio is applied after the stoichiometric point, the closed-loop fuel system will attempt to increase fuel flow to correct the nozzle pressure. However, once past the stoichiometric point, additional fuel will only push the combustion point further away from stoichiometry, resulting in a cooling jet that reduces nozzle pressure. The control system will then send more fuel to the nozzles, leading to an unstable system that drifts until a rich blowout occurs."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Thus, the choice between fuel regulation and nozzle sensing control becomes quite deliberative. Since the afterburning region of a straight-flow engine is between two choked nozzles, the afterburner fuel schedule can be established based on a single parameter (such as compressor outlet pressure) to achieve a constant fuel-air ratio. Other secondary factors (such as combustion efficiency) also need to be considered to obtain the final afterburner fuel schedule."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "For high afterburning ratio engines, the selection of the afterburner control system leans more toward a scheduled fuel system and a signal-sensing nozzle. In fact, studying the operation of other alternative systems reveals why the aforementioned system must be chosen. For high afterburning ratio bypass engines, fuel combustion needs to be near the stoichiometric point, but the challenge is that no single parameter can determine the air mass flow rate. This is because changes in the bypass ratio or \\( T_1 \\) cause variations in the air mass flow rate in the bypass duct without affecting the core engine's dimensionless mass flow rate. Based on this reasoning, as the bypass ratio deviates from the design state, the scheduled nozzle position requires fuel to flow through a sensing system that could suddenly lose control. If a system is designed to account for the bypass ratio in scheduling the nozzle, the system becomes complex and may produce interactions leading to instability. Therefore, a system must be designed that schedules fuel while considering bypass ratio changes and maintains combustion near the stoichiometric point. Additionally, a signal-sensing nozzle system is used to maintain nozzle pressure at a level that prevents surge."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "In pure jet engines, the primary purpose of nozzle regulation is to prevent changes in turbine back pressure, thereby maintaining the core engine in its design state. In bypass engines, when the bypass flow operates at relatively low-pressure ratios, nozzle regulation becomes more critical because the engine's afterburning region no longer operates between critical nozzles. Small changes in nozzle pressure can affect bypass flow efficiency, and even minor errors can cause the bypass flow to stop or even reverse, leading to surge. The nozzle control system must be designed such that the nozzle response time is sufficiently fast to track the fastest commands from the fuel system and quickly respond to nozzle pressure errors to avoid surge."

      "content": "Having decided to use a signal-sensing nozzle control system, the method of actuation must be chosen. Factors influencing this choice are briefly discussed below. As mentioned, transient errors in nozzle pressure and nozzle position should be minimized to prevent surge. To achieve this, the actuation speed for opening and closing the nozzle needs to be as fast as possible. To reduce the system's size and weight, the actuation components must be compact."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Considering these factors, four options are available: mechanical screw actuators, and hydraulic actuators using air, fuel, or oil as the medium. Among these, screw actuators and air actuators may not be adopted due to high costs, inconvenience, and slow operation. Between the remaining two, fuel actuators have the advantage of utilizing an existing high-pressure system, while oil actuators require a separate oil tank and boost system. However, fuel actuators also have disadvantages; during large flow, short-duration transients, they can cause a series of interactions with the fuel system due to fuel flow changes. Using a fuel actuation system also increases fire hazards to some extent. Under flight conditions, the system pressure is the fuel pressure, and at high altitudes, the reduction in fuel pressure can severely affect response speed. Considering these factors, the best system is a separate closed system using oil as the working medium. The system components include a nozzle boost oil tank, main oil pump and return pump, nozzle oil heat exchanger, selector valve, and six hydraulic actuators. The sensing signal is provided by the pressure ratio regulator. Among the two pumps, the low-pressure pump is a gear pump, and the high-pressure pump (main nozzle oil pump) is a positive displacement piston pump. The nozzle oil pump size must ensure sufficient oil delivery to the actuators for rapid nozzle movement, while the oil tank should store enough oil for operation and to compensate for any potential leaks. The nozzle oil tank is pressurized to maintain proper inlet pressure for the low-pressure pump, with compressor seventh-stage bleed air used for pressurization. The size of the restrictor for this purpose is detailed in TDR4159."

      "content": "During non-afterburning operation, when the engine speed is above 80% \\( N_H \\), the nozzle area is required to maintain a reasonably fixed area. To make the engine easier to control at low speeds, a larger readjusted base nozzle area is needed below 80% \\( N_H \\). The design characteristics of the nozzle itself (see TDR782) cause the pressure within the nozzle to tend to open it, so the nozzle control system must counteract this movement. To achieve this, the pressure ratio regulator fixes the nozzle oil pump at a \\( 4 \frac{1},{2}^\\circ \\) stroke position. If left unchecked, the high-pressure oil pressure would increase until it exceeds the relief valve pressure, causing the nozzle to tightly rest against the nozzle actuator stop. Since this results in undesired high nozzle oil pressure, excess heat is generated in the nozzle oil pump, necessitating a selector valve. The mechanical linkage of the selector valve is triggered by the adjustable stop on the nozzle actuator ring housing. When the nozzle closes further, the selector valve's spool moves, diverting high-pressure oil to the low-pressure oil, eliminating high pressure in the actuator. This closes the nozzle to a specified area. A reset valve connected to the mechanical linkage is spring-loaded to maintain its position below 80% \\( N_H \\), with pistons on both sides sensing low-pressure fuel. This facilitates the lever that contacts the adjustable stop, causing the selector valve to operate earlier and maintain a larger nozzle area. When passing the 80% \\( N_H \\) speed limit, the 80% speed switch of the afterburner system schedules a servo oil flow into one side of the reset valve piston, counteracting the spring force. The opposing movement returns the lever, allowing the nozzle to close beyond the area corresponding to 80% \\( N_H \\) before the selector valve acts again."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "The effect of a larger nozzle area below 80% \\( N_H \\) is to lower the low-pressure operating line. At minimum nozzle area, the nozzle flap angle itself is steeper, which is beneficial. Although the flap length is short, it results in a larger area change between the maximum and minimum nozzle areas. Consequently, the flow coefficient at minimum nozzle area and low nozzle pressure ratio is very low. A low flow coefficient tends to increase the back pressure of the low-pressure system, creating a situation similar to that previously described. As nozzle pressure increases, low-pressure surge may occur. This surge is most likely when operating the engine in regions with low flow coefficients. Increasing the nozzle area reduces nozzle pressure, improves the flow coefficient, and moves the low-pressure operating line away from the surge line, making the engine easier to control."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Additionally, lowering the low-pressure operating line is effective when engaging afterburning. During afterburner ignition, a pressure surge occurs within the nozzle, and the operating line must be lowered beforehand. This lowering is achieved by the afterburner reset valve and the nozzle selector valve with mechanical linkage. When afterburning is engaged, a high-pressure fuel servo signal triggered by the pilot's throttle lever is sent to the spring-loaded side of the reset valve chamber. This balances the high-pressure fuel on both sides of the reset valve. Under spring force, the reset piston moves to a pre-open position. This movement is transmitted through the mechanical linkage, and since the selector valve lever is tightly against the nozzle stop position when controlling the nozzle, the reset valve's movement is directly transmitted to the selector valve. The selector valve's movement opens the high-pressure oil return port, allowing the nozzle to open under nozzle load. When the lever quickly contacts the nozzle stop position, it stops moving. During the entire afterburning period, the reset valve and selector valve remain in this position. At this point, the selector valve stops releasing oil, and nozzle regulation is taken over by the pressure ratio regulator. When disengaging afterburning, the servo signal from the pilot's throttle selection lever to the reset valve is canceled, causing the reset valve to return to its position above 80% \\( N_H \\) (afterburning requires the pilot's throttle lever selection valve and the 80% \\( N_H \\) synchronization valve to engage the signal)."

This requires the interlock within the pressure ratio regulator to be canceled, and the pressure ratio regulator to control the swashplate angle of the nozzle oil pump. When afterburning is ignited, a larger nozzle area is required, so the nozzle stop disengages from the selector valve lever, rendering the selector valve inoperative and no longer controlling the nozzle position until afterburning is disengaged."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "If leakage is ignored, the actuator system and nozzle oil pump can be considered as an integrator. Therefore, under stable afterburning conditions, the pump's swashplate angle should be at zero degrees, just maintaining the existing pressure in the actuator. When the signal-sensing system requires a change in nozzle position, the swashplate angle becomes positive or negative (closing or opening the nozzle). While the nozzle is moving as required, the pressure within the nozzle also changes, as does the signal from the sensing device. Ideally, the swashplate returns to the zero-degree position, and the nozzle just reaches the required position. Although there is some uncertainty in nozzle position due to leakage flow in the actuator, this is the principle in theory. In practice, a leakage path is designed into each of the six actuators. The idea is that the actuators are located in the high-temperature region of the engine, especially during afterburning, and leakage acts as a cooling flow. As such, the pump should always be operating to maintain pressure balance between the actuators and nozzle load. For this purpose, the swashplate is often at a small positive angle in steady-state conditions. Based on this action, the technical requirement for the pressure ratio regulator is that the input signal to the pump should have a zero position to adjust the oil pump when the system is unbalanced, ensuring system stability (i.e., the swashplate angle is just enough to compensate for leakage)."

During afterburning operation, the pressure ratio regulator should provide a signal input to the pump to correct nozzle position errors.

The pressure ratio regulator is required to provide a linear variation of \\( P_3 / P_2 \\) with position to facilitate needle valve shaping in the generator.

If the \\( P_3 / P \\) signal relationship is already established, the needle valve system can be designed similarly to the \\( P_3 / P_2 \\) needle valve to provide this relationship. Given the \\( P_3 / P_2 \\) generator, there is a one-to-one relationship between \\( P_3 / P_2 \\) and \\( P_3 / P_6 \\). Therefore, the \\( P_3 / P_2 \\) output can be used to move the trim needle valve, adjusting the \\( P_8 \\) flow to the piston, incorporating the \\( P_3 / P_2 \\) and \\( P_3 / P_8 \\) relationships into the \\( P_3 \\) trim needle valve profile. In practice, two trim needle valves are used, each for different flight conditions. When boundary layer control is applied, the engine's operating line changes, altering the relationship between \\( P_3 / P_2 \\) and \\( P_3 / P_6 \\). Thus, one needle valve is used for normal operation, and another is used when boundary layer control is applied. The selection of the needle valve at any given time is achieved by a boundary layer control sensor that signals the boundary layer control switching valve, as described in TDR7790."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "During transient operation, such as when afterburner is engaged from steady flight, the pressure ratio regulator functions as follows: The \\( P_3 / P_2 \\) needle valve establishes the afterburner fuel flow signal and sets the position of the \\( P_3 \\) trim needle valve, depending on whether boundary layer control is used. A defined orifice diameter is obtained at this point. When the reference \\( P_6 \\) does not equal the actual \\( P_8 \\), the piston moves to change the orifice size, aligning the reference \\( P_8 \\) with the actual \\( P_6 \\). This movement is transmitted to the exhaust nozzle oil pump, altering the pump stroke and causing the actuator to move. When \\( P_8 \\) recovers, the pressure error on the piston decreases, and the piston moves toward its null position. The speed at which the null position is reached can be adjusted by the \\( P_3 / P_6 \\) needle valve profile attached to the piston. A needle valve with a small taper requires a large displacement to balance the forces on the piston, making it easy for the pump to increase its stroke, providing a large flow rate to the actuator and achieving a rapid response. However, in this case, the system is highly sensitive and tends to be unstable. Conversely, a needle valve with a large taper is very stable but responds slowly to exhaust nozzle movement. This necessitates the calibration of multiple needle valves with different profiles to adjust the system's effective gain. The existing needle valve profile is a compromise between these two requirements (see TDR7782). The control section of the needle valve has a large taper, resulting in slow exhaust nozzle movement and stable regulation. The system's null position is also on this large taper section, providing excellent stability. The rest of the needle valve profile consists of two parts: a cylindrical section in the opening direction to achieve virtually infinite gain, and a small taper section in the closing direction to provide very high gain. Thus, the system responds rapidly to large disturbances."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "Next, consider the scenario requiring a large change in exhaust nozzle position. Initially, in steady-state, the needle valve regulates the exhaust nozzle using the null position (i.e., the designed taper section). When the piston pressure ratio changes, the piston moves to balance the acting forces. For small pressure differences, the needle valve still regulates the nozzle within the taper section. However, for large changes in nozzle position considered here, the needle valve moves out of the taper section into a high-gain section. At this point, the pressure difference no longer encounters resistance, and depending on the required direction of nozzle movement, the piston moves the exhaust nozzle oil pump to maximum or minimum stroke, providing rapid nozzle movement. As the nozzle moves, the piston pressure begins to recover, and the piston starts moving in the opposite direction to its control position. This slows down the oil pump's supply rate, but the needle valve remains in its high-gain section, quickly returning to the taper section until piston pressure balance is achieved. The end of the return movement is slow back to the null position. Detailed descriptions of early needle valve profile designs can be found in TDR779. The calculation methods therein serve only as a guide, as some profiles have been modified during the adjustment of response speed and stability factors (see TDR7782)."

The afterburner system and exhaust nozzle control system must operate reliably under various flight conditions. The most extreme scenario is catapult takeoff under afterburner conditions. During catapulting, the engine experiences short-term \\(6g\\) loads. A balanced piston may move under \\(6g\\) load, altering the control parameters. Further design work has been done to mitigate these load effects. A typical example is described in TDR7107, which considers engine performance compensation for these accelerations."

This is achieved by attaching a clutch to the needle valve position. In non-afterburning mode, the clutch engages, holding the pressure ratio regulator needle valve in the required fixed position. When afterburner is engaged, a servo signal from the low-pressure shutdown switch is sent to the pressure ratio regulator. This signal opposes the pressure load holding the clutch engaged. The servo signal disengages the clutch, activating the pressure ratio regulator. The needle valve is positioned to close the exhaust nozzle, which has been pre-opened by the retracting valve schedule. The pump then moves to full positive stroke, maintaining the retracting valve operation until afterburner ignition and \\( P_6 \\) rise. As \\( P_6 \\) increases, the pressure ratio regulator senses \\( P_8 \\), causing the exhaust nozzle to open beyond the retracting valve lever's range. At this point, the retracting valve ceases operation, and the pressure ratio regulator takes over exhaust nozzle control."

Under the seven flight conditions mentioned, the effect of a 10% step change in afterburner level on various parameters is shown by the solid lines in Figures 6, 7, and 8. The second \\( P_3 / P_6 \\) needle valve profile is designed to produce the same \\( P_3 / P_6 \\) error as commonly used in similar pressure ratio devices, with a maximum stroke error of ±0.32. Under the same flight conditions and the same afterburner step change, the effect on various engine parameters is shown by the dash-dot lines in Figures 6, 7, and 8. It can be seen that the second needle valve profile (dash-dot lines) provides a slower response than the first (solid lines) but with no overshoot. Moreover, considering the disturbance level measured with the first needle valve profile's \\( P_3 / P_6 \\) pressure ratio piston, which produces a maximum piston position error of ±0.02, the piston is prone to oscillatory movement.

This means the pressure ratio device can be precisely adjusted at a certain point on the needle valve profile, while other points on the profile are only accurate within the needle valve diameter tolerance limits. From a manufacturing perspective, the minimum allowable diameter error is 0.0006. Due to inaccuracies in the needle valve profile, it is preferable to lower the operating line rather than raise it. Therefore, the impact of positive (i.e., manufacturing) tolerances has been estimated. This situation is illustrated in Figure 9, showing the effect on the low-pressure compressor operating line. Below an inlet mass flow function of 170, there is no difference between the correct and incorrect operating lines. Even at the worst point, the impact of the tolerance on the operating line, reflected in the pressure ratio, is only 0.06, which is considered acceptable."

Using the characteristics of the pump and negative ratio orifice combination, the actual maximum swashplate error within the specified limits is -0.16°. However, at maximum exhaust nozzle load (30746 lbs, at 31546 feet, Mach number = 2.146, afterburner not ignited—see TDR782), the swashplate error reaches -0.6°. This causes a -0.015-inch stroke error in the \\( P_3 / P_6 \\) piston, which raises the operating line by less than one-third of the movement caused by the needle valve profile tolerance, and is considered acceptable."

The actuator position is made to have a single-valued relationship with N/√T through the following method: The actuator linkage is connected to the regulator linkage, which rotates a cam to lift one end of the feedback spring. The other end of the spring is acted upon by a component of the force generated by the governor rotating at a certain transmission ratio from the engine's high-pressure shaft. The magnitude of this force is altered by a movable pivot that changes with T₁, ensuring that the spring load equals K N²/T₁. One end of the spring is connected to the governor valve, which directs high-pressure or low-pressure fuel to either side of the actuator piston based on the valve's movement direction. In steady-state conditions, the valve must be at or near the null position, and the cam lift is linearly related to the spring load. Therefore, the actuator position has a single-valued relationship with N²/T₁ as determined by the cam profile."

Therefore, P₃ air is used on the Spey MK202 to minimize T₁ errors caused by the venturi not reaching choking. This issue is further exacerbated by the fact that most P₃ air is drawn from the anti-icing manifold. When anti-icing air flows at full capacity, the pressure loss in the anti-icing manifold reduces the available ejector pressure ratio from 4.7:1 to less than 4:1."
