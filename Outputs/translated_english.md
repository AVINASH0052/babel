# Publisher’s Note

In accordance with the technical transfer license agreement for the **Spey MK202 engine** (designated as the **WS-9 turbofan engine** in China), **Rolls-Royce plc** provided **132 original design calculation reports and development test reports** for the Spey MK202 engine. These documents cover the following aspects:

- **Aerothermal design and development testing** of the engine’s **compressor, combustion chamber, turbine, mixer, and afterburner**;
- **Cooling design and testing** of turbine blades;
- **Technical design** of the **fuel control system, anti-icing system, cooling system, air supply system, lubrication system, and anti-surge mechanism**;
- **Stress analysis** of **casings, shafts, disks, blades, and mounting lugs**;
- **Design philosophy** for **gears and bearings**;
- **Engine starting performance and endurance test procedures**.

The reports systematically introduce the **design philosophy, methodologies, and improvement processes** of the Spey MK202 engine.

This marks the first instance in China of importing a **complete set of design documentation for a turbofan engine**. Upon receipt of these materials in **1976**, the **Sixth Academy of the Ministry of Aviation Industry (MAI)** organized affiliated factories, design institutes, and universities to study and digest the content through **reverse-engineering**. This effort yielded numerous valuable design methodologies, with some materials offering significant reference value for China’s new engine development programs.

To facilitate the dissemination of Spey design technology, in early **1981**, Ministry leadership appointed **Comrade Wu Da Guan** to oversee the evaluation and publication of these materials. In February of the same year, a **publication review meeting** was convened, attended by relevant factories, design institutes, and universities under the **Sixth Academy of MAI**. During this meeting, all **132 reports** were evaluated and categorized into four groups:

1. **Reports with reference value for China’s new aero-engine development**;
2. **Reports with reference value for the Spey MK202 engine’s own modification and development**;
3. **Reports with reference value for China’s industrial and marine gas turbine design and development**;
4. **Reports with outdated or limited reference value**.

Based on this classification, **26 reports** from **Category 1** and **20 reports** from **Categories 2 and 3** were selected for publication, totaling **46 reports**. The review meeting also recommended publishing the lecture notes compiled by Rolls-Royce during training sessions for Chinese engineers:
- **"Spey MK202 Engine Technical Design (EGD-6)"**
- **"Spey MK202 Engine Stress Analysis (EGD-7)"**

Although this compilation includes only **46 reports**, the content remains comprehensive, retaining the essence of each category. We hope this compilation, along with the previously published **"EGD-3"**, **"EGD-6"**, and **"EGD-7"**, will benefit professionals engaged in **gas turbine research, design, manufacturing, and education**, enabling Spey technology to play its due role in advancing China’s gas turbine industry.

This compilation is published in **three volumes**:
- **Volume I**: Design and development of **compressor and turbine components**;
- **Volume II**: Design and development of the **main combustion chamber, afterburner, fuel control system, nozzle control system, and anti-surge mechanism**;
- **Volume III**: **Stress analysis** of **disks, shafts, casings, mounting lugs, gears, and bearings**, as well as technical design of the **lubrication system and starting system**.

# 1. Introduction

Reference [1] specifies the performance requirements for the MK202 combustion chamber. This report describes the methods used in the design of the tubo-annular combustion chamber to meet these requirements.

The design of the MK202 is fundamentally based on the civil Spey design, which itself was initially derived from existing engine designs at the time. After the initial design, experience was accumulated, and design methods were revised where necessary. This report presents these methods, which can now be used at the start of a new design, rather than the methods originally employed in the Spey design.

## 2. Combustion Chamber Overview

The combustion chamber consists of a number of circular flame tubes, each fitted at the front (upstream) with an air intake (commonly referred to as a "snout intake") and a fuel nozzle, and at the rear with a gas duct to direct high-temperature gas into the turbine. The flame tubes are mounted within an annular cavity formed by the inner and outer casings. For ignition, interconnector tubes are installed between the flame tubes to allow flame propagation from the two flame tubes equipped with ignition plugs.

Before the airflow enters the air holes of the flame tube, the velocity of the airflow discharged from the compressor must be significantly reduced. Control of this diffusion process is critical to the successful operation of the combustion chamber.

The combustion chamber space (the volume enclosed by the flame tube and gas duct) can be divided into three zones (see **Figure 1**):

(i) **Primary Zone or Recirculation Zone**: In this zone, fuel is injected as a well-atomized spray cone, and the flame is stabilized by continuous recirculation of a portion of the high-temperature combustion gas. The high-temperature gas flows back from the rear of the flame tube into the fuel spray. This zone extends from the front of the flame tube to the rear of the secondary holes.

(ii) **Intermediate Zone or Secondary Zone**: In most cases, combustion reactions are completed in this zone. The amount of air entering this zone depends on maintaining an average fuel-air ratio below a certain limit, as discussed in **Section 4.1**.

For the Spey, apart from the air entering from the primary zone, the air entering this zone comes through wall cooling holes.

(iii) **Dilution Zone or Tertiary Zone**: The remaining air is introduced into this zone to meet the temperature distribution requirements at the gas duct outlet, as specified in **Section 4.6 of Reference [1]**.

At the secondary hole section, **5.5%** of the compressor discharge air is extracted through the inner casing to cool the turbine. Additionally, **3.8%** of the air is extracted from the rear of the gas duct to cool the turbine guide vanes.

## 3. Flame Tube Dimensions of the Combustion Chamber

The design of the tubo-annular combustion chamber must satisfy the following requirements:

3.1 The volume of the primary zone must be sufficiently large to ensure an adequate in-flight relight envelope (see **Section 4.1 of Reference [1]**).

3.2 The length-to-depth ratio of the flame tube must be sufficiently large to ensure adequate mixing of the fuel-air mixture before the gas duct outlet plane.

3.3 The total volume enclosed by the flame tube and gas duct must be sufficiently large to avoid limiting the temperature rise required by the engine during acceleration to idle after an in-flight relight.

3.4 To minimize flow disturbances, the flame tubes should be positioned as close as possible to the mean radius of the compressor outlet.

3.5 When assembled in the engine, there must be adequate spacing between flame tubes. The following factors must also be considered:

   3.5.1 Flow area for flame tube cooling air.

   3.5.2 The length of the interconnector tubes should be minimized.

3.6 The combustion chamber should be as short as possible to reduce weight and minimize the amount of cooling air required for the flame tubes (which is critical for controlling the temperature distribution at the flame tube outlet plane).

### 3.7 To meet the above requirements, the number and size of the flame tubes are matched as follows:

#### 3.7.1 Primary Zone Structure

The primary zone structure is based on earlier designs with proven relight performance. The latter had an ignition envelope that met or slightly exceeded the requirements of the new design. The scaling method is based on the following principles:

(a) Under similar fuel atomization characteristics and constant inlet pressure and temperature, the ignition performance of the combustion chamber is proportional to the volume of the primary zone (\(V\)) and inversely proportional to the airflow into the primary zone (\(M_p\)).

(b) At any flight speed and altitude, when the engine flames out (windmilling condition), the pressure and temperature at the combustion chamber inlet remain essentially constant, regardless of engine type. Thus, the total airflow through the flame tube (\(M\)) is proportional to the "effective throat area of the high-pressure turbine guide vanes (\(A_T\))".

   \(A_T\) is defined as "the choked flow area (Mach number = 1.0) at the gas duct outlet under design or takeoff conditions."

(c) For a single flame tube, the volume of the primary zone is proportional to the cube of the flame tube diameter (\(D^3\)). Therefore, the total volume of the primary zone is proportional to \(N D^3\), where \(N\) is the number of flame tubes.

(d) The proportion of airflow entering the primary zone, \(M_p / M\), is derived from the richest stable combustion condition (see **Section 4.1**).

As described above, when ignition performance is held constant, \(V \propto N D^3 \propto M_p \propto \left( \frac{M_p}{M} \times M \right) \propto \frac{M_p}{M} \cdot A_T\).

For the MK202, \(A_T = 41.8 \text{ in}^2\), and \(\frac{M_p}{M} = 37.5\%\).

Based on this scaling of earlier designs, the required \(N D^3\) value to meet relight requirements at 33,500 feet is **1400 in³**.

#### 3.7.2 Number of Flame Tubes

To satisfy the requirements in **Sections 3.5.1** and **3.5.2**, the minimum spacing between flame tubes when installed in the engine is set at **0.27 in**. Thus, the distance between the inner diameters of adjacent flame tubes is **0.57 in**. When arranging the flame tubes along the mean radius of the compressor outlet (**9.67 in**), the number of flame tubes can be approximated by the following formula:

\[
N = \frac{9.67 \times 2 \pi}{D + 0.57}
\]

Considering the requirement for \(N D^3\) (**= 1400 in³**), the number of flame tubes is calculated as **10.8**, which is rounded to **10**. To maintain the same spacing between flame tubes, the pitch radius of the flame tube centerline is reduced to **9.35 in**.

#### 3.7.3 Combustion Length

Once the diameter of the primary zone flame tube is determined, the combustion length (from the fuel injection plane to the gas duct outlet) can be derived based on the length-to-diameter ratio used in previous combustion chamber designs. The Spey has a length-to-diameter ratio of **2.66**, which is relatively short compared to many other designs but has proven to be highly satisfactory.

#### 3.7.4 Total Combustion Volume

Although the combustion volume (i.e., the volume enclosed by the flame tube and gas duct) is effectively determined by the primary zone dimensions and combustion length, the ability of the combustion chamber to accommodate high-altitude relight requirements must also be considered.

The combustion volume is only critical during relight at high altitude and low speed (Mach number below 0.6). Under these conditions, the following scenario may occur: the combustion chamber ignites, but the engine fails to accelerate to idle speed. This is due to excessively low combustion efficiency, a phenomenon that occurs in any combustion chamber when inlet pressure and temperature are very low. As altitude increases, pressure and temperature become extremely low, and combustion efficiency drops significantly (typical values as low as **10%**), such that the temperature rise in the combustion chamber is ultimately insufficient to accelerate the engine, regardless of the amount of fuel injected.

One method to improve combustion efficiency is to increase the combustion volume, which raises the altitude at which "acceleration failure" occurs. This issue has not been encountered in the Spey engine. However, to ensure cold relight capability at **28,500 feet**, it is undesirable to reduce the scaled combustion volume determined for the Spey. The scaled volume for the Spey was established by considering both ignition performance and length-to-depth ratio, with a minimum ratio of:

\[
\frac{354}{40} + \frac{3}{4} \times 11 \times \frac{2540}{A_T} = \frac{2540 \times 11.5 \times 7}{41.8 \times 11.5 \times 7} = 60.7
\]

#### 3.7.5 Casing Dimensions

After determining the flame tube dimensions and pitch radius (the distance from the flame tube centerline to the engine centerline), the inner and outer casing diameters are defined as follows:

(a) The inner diameter of the outer casing is set at **24.56 in**, with a minimum practical clearance of **0.2 in** between the casing and the flame tube.

(b) The inner casing is initially arranged such that the airflow area on the inner half of the flame tube (supply area) relative to the open hole area of the flame tube is equal to that on the outer half. During development, the dimensions of the flame tube openings were modified, and this ratio is no longer equal. However, this is not considered critical.

The inner casing diameter is **12.02 in**, with a clearance of **0.6 in** between the casing and the flame tube.

## 4. Airflow Distribution

The airflow distribution into the combustion chamber is shown in **Figure 2**. The rationale for this distribution is as follows:

### 4.1 Primary Zone

This zone extends to the rear of the secondary air holes (see **Figure 1**). The total airflow is such that, under the richest stable combustion condition, the average fuel-air ratio at the zone outlet is **0.057**. This mixture concentration ensures sufficient oxygen to complete combustion in the intermediate zone while preventing excessive radiative heat flux to the flame tube walls. Under these conditions, the total airflow entering the primary zone accounts for **37.5%** of the combustion chamber airflow.

The distribution of airflow between the swirler, secondary air, and cooling air is primarily based on earlier experience. While it is desirable to use most of the air for cooling the flame tube head, this proportion must balance wall temperature and combustion efficiency, as excessive cooling air can severely impact combustion efficiency.

## 4.2 Intermediate Zone

As explained in Section 2, the amount of air required in this zone of the flame tube, where only cooling air enters, is still determined based on early experience and subsequent tuning conducted on combustion test rigs. The mechanism of heat transfer to the walls is too complex to allow for reliable analysis during the design phase, although wall temperatures can be calculated analytically under conditions of mild extrapolation. An explanation of this method is provided in Appendix 1.

## 4.3 Mixing Zone

The primary consideration for the mixing zone is effective wall cooling. The remaining air can then be introduced through mixing holes. The size and arrangement of the mixing holes are discussed in Section 7.3.

# 5. Selection of Pressure Drop

Although the pressure drop generated by airflow through the combustor has no significant impact on engine performance, it is clearly desirable to keep it to a minimum. A key requirement for the combustor is its ability to accommodate the basic total pressure distribution at the compressor outlet and to minimize changes in combustor performance caused by variations in this total pressure distribution during engine operation. For this reason, pressure loss is typically related to the dynamic head at the compressor outlet (the difference between the average total pressure and static pressure). In this case, the total loss through the combustor equals one dynamic head calculated based on a compressor outlet area of **74.7 square inches**.

This loss can be divided into four parts:

(a) Loss between the compressor outlet and the inlet front end.
(b) Loss from the inlet front end to the flame tube.
(c) Pressure drop along the flame tube.
(d) Fundamental loss due to heating (a function of the temperature ratio \( T_{outlet}/T_{inlet} \) across the combustor).

The approximate values for the four pressure drops are:
(a) **0.13 velocity heads**
(b) **0.13 velocity heads**
(c) **0.67 velocity heads**
(d) **0.07 velocity heads**, when \( T_{outlet}/T_{inlet} = 2.0 \).

# 6. Diffuser Design

The air at the compressor outlet must be decelerated before entering the flame tube for the following reasons:

1. The higher the airflow velocity near the holes, the lower the flow coefficient. This necessitates an increase in hole area.
2. High airflow velocity between the flame tube and casing requires a very small air gap, which is impractical.
3. Changes in channel shape or encountering obstacles (fuel pipes, igniters, interconnector tubes) will result in large pressure drops and severe flow disturbances.

In the cannular combustor design, controlling this diffusion process is challenging. The inlet of the channel is annular, but downstream, a significant amount of air flows into the space between the circular flame tubes and the annular casing. The problems caused by this change in channel shape are exacerbated by large struts at the channel inlet section and the non-uniform total pressure distribution at the compressor outlet.

For the section before the channel shape changes, the Spey engine employs a large-angle diffuser (included angle **14°**), increasing the annular cross-sectional area of the channel by **0.5 times**. The channel shape is then altered via the inlet ports at the front of the flame tube. The diffuser profile is designed to ensure that the flow area remains effectively constant during the channel shape transition.

The front end of the inlet is positioned at the location of the highest pressure at the diffuser outlet. This is not only to direct air into the first zone of the flame tube but also to distribute air backward into the gaps between the flame tube and the inner and outer casings. Without this device, the airflow entering the gaps between the flame tube and the inner and outer casings would consist of low-pressure air from the compressor blade roots, tips, and the boundary layers along the diffuser walls. The resulting poor velocity distribution in the annular channel would have a severe impact on the flame tube wall temperature (see Section 2 and Figure 5 in Reference [2]).

Baffles and deflectors installed at and behind the mixing holes are also used to mitigate the effects of poor total pressure distribution. For a simple open channel with side-wall exhaust, variations in supply pressure will create strong disturbances downstream of the exhaust. These disturbances generate local vortices, which, if the vortex center is at the inlet hole, will reduce the flow through the hole. In extreme cases, this can cause hot gas to flow from the flame tube into the annular cavity. The presence of deflectors can significantly reduce such disturbances, while any smaller vortices are controlled and minimized by baffles (see Section 2 and Figure 4 in Reference [2]).

# 7. Flame Tube Design

## 7.1 Primary Zone

In the primary zone (see Figure 1), a swirler is installed around the fuel nozzle to create a recirculation zone of hot gas. The swirler channels **11%** of the total flame tube airflow and consists of ten straight vanes set at a **45°** angle to induce swirl. This swirling air then flows into the hemispherical head, providing a sufficiently large contact area to carry away the hot gas from the recirculation zone.

The secondary air jets injected from ten secondary air holes (matching the number of swirler vanes) enhance the recirculation. The arrangement of these secondary air holes is one of the most critical aspects of combustor design. This is because the secondary air serves two purposes: controlling the flow pattern in the recirculation zone and providing a satisfactory mixture distribution for the intermediate zone. Extensive research was conducted on the secondary air inlet scoops in this design to achieve satisfactory mechanical and thermodynamic performance (see Section 7 of Reference [2]).

## 7.2 Intermediate Zone

The intermediate zone occupies **32%** of the total combustion volume. Its functions are to complete the reaction process initiated in the primary zone and to provide a mixing length before the introduction of dilution air. Under high-pressure conditions, it also serves to burn off a significant amount of carbon (or soot) produced in the primary zone.

The flame tube walls are cooled by a series of slots controlled by corrugated strips. Ideally, the cooling air film would be introduced into the flame tube through a continuous annular passage, but this is impractical. Extensive research was conducted on the design of the cooling strips, and it was demonstrated that corrugated strips offer the best compromise in terms of cooling efficiency, mechanical reliability, and cost (including manufacturing and maintenance).

## 7.3 Mixing Zone

The primary mixing holes must serve two functions:

(i) Uniformly distribute cold air into the hot gas.
(ii) Generate high mixing velocities.

While small-hole jets mix faster than large-hole jets, they cannot penetrate to the center of the flame tube. Therefore, most of the dilution air is introduced through four large holes from the deepest part of the annular cavity between the flame tube and the inner and outer casings into the hot gas from the intermediate zone.

Achieving the required outlet temperature distribution (as specified in Section 4.6 of Reference [1]) relies almost entirely on tuning conducted on combustion test rigs or in the engine. It was during this tuning process that three additional smaller holes were added. Based on mechanical and aerodynamic considerations, all mixing holes are equipped with radial flanges. The flanges reduce crack propagation from the edges, and the flange radius maintains a nearly constant jet penetration angle.

All cooling air in the gas duct section of this zone is introduced through splash cooling rings. This air cools the inner liner via splash or impingement before entering the combustion space to form a cooling film. This type of ring is less effective than corrugated strips but is the only design mechanically adaptable to the complex profile of the gas duct, particularly where it transitions from circular to annular and intersects with the ten turbine bearing struts.

## 7.4 Interconnector Tube Design

The primary zones of the ten flame tubes are all connected via interconnector tubes. During engine start-up, these tubes allow the flame to propagate from the two flame tubes equipped with igniters to the remaining flame tubes. To effectively propagate the flame (especially during high-altitude relight), the interconnector tubes should be positioned as close as possible to the flame tube head, their cross-sectional area should be maximized, and their length should be minimized. Cold air entering the interconnector tubes (whether for cooling or due to leakage) will cool the propagating flame and impair ignition propagation characteristics. However, without cooling air, the interconnector tubes may overheat, and if the tubes are too large, the downstream flow may be affected, leading to localized overheating of the flame tube. Therefore, extensive tuning research was required to determine a satisfactory compromise for the interconnector tube area (see Sections 8 and 9 of Reference [2]). Once all flame tubes are ignited, there is no longer a need for hot gas to flow through the interconnector tubes.

## Appendix 1

### Heat Transfer Processes in the Combustor

Under steady-state conditions, the wall temperature at any point on the combustor flame tube is the result of a balance between four heat flows:

\[
R_1 + C_1 = R_2 + C_2
\]

Where:
- \( R_1 \): Radiation from the gas to the wall
- \( C_1 \): Convective heat transfer from the gas flow inside the flame tube to the wall (sometimes negative)
- \( R_2 \): Radiation from the wall to the casing
- \( C_2 \): Convective heat transfer from the flame tube to the external air

*Note: Heat conduction through the flame tube wall is typically negligible and is not considered here. The above quantities are all functions of wall temperature.*

Where:
- \( E_w \): Wall emissivity (taken as 0.7)
- \( E_G \): Gas emissivity (see below)
- \( T_G \): Gas temperature (°K)
- \( T_w \): Wall temperature (°K)

\[
R_2 = 1.01 \times 10^{-8} E_{EFF} (T_w^4 - T_c^4) \quad \text{CHU/ft·h}
\]

Where:
- \( T_c \): Casing temperature (based on compressor discharge temperature) (°K)
- \( E_{EFF} \): Effective emissivity for the specific geometry (taken as 0.396 CHU/ft²·h·°K⁴)

\[
C_1 = h_1 (T_F - T_w) \quad \text{CHU/ft²·h}
\]

Where:
- \( h_1 \): Heat transfer coefficient (CHU/ft²·h·°K) (see below)

\[
C_2 = h_2 (T_w - T_c) \quad \text{CHU/ft·h}
\]

Where:
- \( h_2 \): Heat transfer coefficient for air flowing over the outer flame tube wall (see below)
- \( T_c \): Air temperature outside the flame tube (based on compressor discharge temperature) (°K)

The gas emissivity (\( E_G \)) is calculated as follows:

\[
E_G = 1 - \exp \left[ -1.09 \times 10^3 P_G L (r \cdot l)^{0.5} T_G^{-1.5} \right]
\]

Where:
- \( L \): Luminosity factor (1.72 for kerosene)
- \( r \): Fuel-air ratio (local value)
- \( l \): Radiation length (for a circular flame tube = 0.6 × diameter) (ft)
- \( P_G \): Gas pressure (psi)
- \( T_G \): Gas temperature (°K)

The heat transfer coefficient on the inner wall (hot side) is given by:

\[
h_1 = \frac{K_1}{x_1} \left( \frac{M_F x_1}{A_F \mu} \right)^{0.8}
\]

Where:
- \( K_1 \): Thermal conductivity of the cooling air film (CHU/ft·h·°K)
- \( x_1 \): Hydraulic diameter of the cooling air film = 2 × film slot height
- \( M_F \): Cooling air film flow rate (lb/h)
- \( A_F \): Initial area of the cooling air film (ft²)
- \( \mu \): Dynamic viscosity of the cooling air film (lb/ft·h)

The film temperature \( T_F \) is a function of the amount of hot gas entrained into the film and is determined based on the dimensionless film temperature \( \eta_F \), commonly referred to as film efficiency:

\[
\eta_F = \frac{T_G - T_F}{T_G - T_C}
\]

Thus,

\[
T_F = T_G - \eta_F (T_G - T_C)
\]

The empirical relationship for \( \eta_F \) is:

\[
\eta_F = 1 - \exp \left( -\frac{44.1}{X} \right)
\]

Where:

\[
X = \alpha \left( \frac{V_G}{V_C} \right)^{0.8} \left( \frac{T_G}{T_C} \right)^{0.2} \frac{x^{0.8}}{s} \quad \left( \text{for } \frac{V_G}{V_C} \geq 0.8 \right)
\]

and

\[
X = \alpha \left( \frac{V_G}{V_C} \right)^{0.6} \left( \frac{T_G}{T_C} \right)^{0.2} \frac{x^{0.8}}{s} \left( \frac{V_G}{V_C} + 0.2 \right)^{-1.25} \quad \left( \text{for } \frac{V_G}{V_C} < 0.8 \right)
\]

Where:
- \( \alpha \): Empirical coefficient dependent on the film slot geometry (for the Spey corrugated strip, \( \alpha = 3.0 \))
- \( x \): Distance along the flow direction from the film inlet plane (inches)
- \( s \): Height of the film slot (inches)
- \( V_G, V_C \): Velocities of the hot gas and film at the inlet, respectively

The heat transfer coefficient on the outer wall (cold side) \( h_2 \) is given by:

\[
h_2 = 0.02 \frac{K_2}{x_2} \left( \frac{M_a x_2}{A_a \mu} \right)^{0.8}
\]

Where:
- \( K_2 \): Thermal conductivity of the cooling air (CHU/ft·h·°K)
- \( x_2 \): Hydraulic diameter of the supply annulus = 4 × flow area / wetted perimeter
- \( M_a \): Airflow rate outside the flame tube (lb/h)
- \( A_a \): Flow area of the annulus (ft²)
- \( \mu \): Dynamic viscosity of the annulus airflow (lb/ft·h)

Since the metal wall temperature \( T_w \) is unknown, the heat balance equation is solved using an iterative approximation method. Due to the large computational load, the solution process is typically performed on a digital computer.

|--------------------------------|--------------|
| **Spey MK202 Engine Fuel Nozzle Design** |              |

# Introduction

A centrifugal fuel nozzle consists of a swirl chamber and a discharge orifice. Fuel enters the swirl chamber through tangential slots (machined tangentially to the swirl chamber wall), then exits the orifice in the form of a well-atomized spray cone.

The tangential velocity of the fuel, generated by the pressure drop across the inlet slots, is converted into three velocity components (tangential, radial, and axial), forming a free vortex with superimposed axial velocity. The fuel exits the orifice with both tangential and axial velocity components, producing a hollow spray cone.

Under conditions considering friction, boundary layers, and viscous effects, the theory describing this mechanism is highly complex. Rolls-Royce’s approach is to design nozzles using empirical methods. These empirical methods are based on single-circuit centrifugal nozzle theory (neglecting losses) and are established through data accumulated from numerous practical designs.

# Abstract

Centrifugal nozzles can now be designed to meet the following specifications: flow number (FN) range of **0.2–0.9** with an error of **±5%**, and spray cone angle of **70°–115°** with an error of **±5°**. Most fuel nozzles used by Rolls-Royce are dual-circuit, consisting of two single-circuit nozzles in parallel. One is nested inside the other, and the additional design features required for such nozzles are provided in **Appendix 2**.

## Basic Definitions

\[
\text{Flow Number (FN)} = \frac{Q}{\sqrt{P}}
\]

**Spray Cone Angle** = The angle formed by the fuel spray cone, as determined in the following diagram:

- **P** = Pressure drop across the nozzle (psi)
- **K** = Flow coefficient
- **Aₚ** = Swirl slot area (in²)
- **D** = Swirl chamber diameter (in)
- **d** = Orifice diameter (in)
- **L** = Swirl chamber length (in)
- **r₁** = Orifice radius (d/2) (in)
- **l** = Orifice length (in)
- **r₂** = Swirl slot offset radius (in)
- **Reynolds Number (Re)** = \(\frac{Vd\rho}{\mu}\)
  Where:
  - **V** = Velocity
  - **ρ** = Density
  - **μ** = Dynamic viscosity
  - **d** = Characteristic dimension

### Derivation of Design Rules

Since the development of gas turbine engines, the theoretical description of fuel flow characteristics in centrifugal nozzles has been a subject of research. The primary difficulty lies in viscous and frictional losses, but relationships between nozzle dimensions and spray characteristics can still be derived.

For example, Giffen and Muraszew used single-circuit inviscid flow nozzle theory to derive the relationship between flow coefficient, spray cone angle, and nozzle dimensions \(\left(\frac{A_p}{D_2 D_1}\right)\) (see attached paper at the end of this report).

Radcliffe studied the performance of centrifugal nozzles with different geometries and established the relationship between spray cone angle, orifice diameter, and swirl slot area (Aₚ).

It is known that the flow coefficient **K** varies with Reynolds number **Re** (with the characteristic dimension taken as the orifice diameter). Carlisle improved this relationship by deriving a function for the flow coefficient corrected to the same Reynolds number **Re**. The design method’s \(\mathbf{d \sqrt{P}}\) relationship accounts for Reynolds number effects.

Comparison of Radcliffe’s work with Rolls-Royce’s experimental data from Carlisle shows good agreement in spray cone angle and flow coefficient. This agreement is achieved by accounting for the deviation of the theoretical spray cone angle due to Reynolds number effects in the orifice.

This "consideration" is also reflected in the design method (relationship between **Kd/21000** and spray cone angle deviation).

Based on these relationships, a design method was developed, and all pressure-atomizing nozzles subsequently used by Rolls-Royce were designed using this approach.

Note: The following two references are attached at the end of this report:
- *"Theory of Centrifugal Nozzles"* – Giffen and Muraszew
- *"Performance of Centrifugal Nozzles"* – Radcliffe (including Carlisle’s comments)

#### Nozzle Design for Given Flow Number and Spray Angle Using Kerosene with Specific Gravity of 0.8

1. From **Figure 1** (relationship between spray cone angle and flow coefficient **K**), determine the approximate flow coefficient **K** corresponding to the selected spray cone angle.

2. Substitute this **K** value into the following equation to calculate the orifice diameter:

\[
d = 0.0245 \sqrt{\frac{FN}{K}}
\]

(See **Appendix 1(a)**)

3. Apply Reynolds number correction using **Figure 2** (relationship between **Kd/21000** and spray cone angle deviation).

   If a positive deviation is indicated, subtract this value from the selected spray cone angle design value and determine a new **K** from **Figure 1**. Similarly, if a negative deviation is indicated, add this value to the selected spray cone angle design value and determine a new **K**.

4. Recalculate the orifice diameter using the new **K** value:

\[
d = 0.0245 \sqrt{\frac{FN}{K}}
\]

5. Carlisle’s Reynolds number correction is based on \(\mathbf{d \sqrt{P}} = 0.707\).

   Using the nozzle’s operating pressure (typically selected at maximum fuel flow condition) and the orifice diameter obtained in step (4), apply Reynolds number correction using **Figure 3**.

   If \(\mathbf{d \sqrt{P}} \neq 0.707\), use the following formula for the reference flow number:

   Apply the **K** value obtained in step (3).

6. The ideal swirl chamber dimension ratio is:

   If this ratio cannot be applied, correct the **K** value using **Figure 4** (relationship between base value and \(\frac{L}{D} \times \frac{D}{d}\)).

7. Use the ideal **K** value obtained from **Figure 4** to determine \(\frac{A_p}{\pi r_1 r_2}\) (from **Figure 5**).

8. If the swirl chamber offset radius (**r₂**) is known, the swirl slot area can be calculated. However, before determining the swirl slot dimensions, **r₂** cannot be precisely known. Therefore, an approximate value for **r₂** (e.g., using the swirl chamber diameter) is used to calculate the swirl slot area and dimensions, followed by recalculation with the precise **r₂** value.

   The general rule for the number of swirl slots is: for flow numbers less than **1.0**, use **2 or 3** slots; for flow numbers greater than **3.0**, use **6** slots.

   Swirl slots are typically milled and should be as close to square as possible (i.e., depth = width).

   Note: The more swirl slots used, the better the fuel distribution, but each slot should not be smaller than **0.010 in** to prevent clogging by contaminants. This rule applies to most nozzles.

The following is a sample calculation demonstrating the application of the above design method.

### Spey Main Fuel Nozzle Sample Calculation

- **Flow Number (FN)** = **5.5**
- **Spray Cone Angle** = **100°** (nominal)
- **Operating Pressure (Pressure Drop)** = **500 psi**

From **Figure 3**, **K = 0.184**; **d = 0.0245 \(\sqrt{\frac{5.5}{0.184}}\) = 0.134**

**K \(\frac{d}{2} \times 1000 = 12.3\)**; from **Figure 2**, deviation = **+8.8°**

From **Figure 1**, spray cone angle = **91.2°**; **K = 0.233**; **d = 0.120**

**d \(\sqrt{P} = 2.68\)**; from **Figure 3**, required FN = **0.955 × base FN**

Base FN = **5.76**

\[
d = 0.0245 \sqrt{\frac{5.76}{0.233}} = 0.122
\]

\(\frac{L}{D} = \frac{0.295}{0.222} = 1.33\); \(\frac{D}{d} = \frac{0.222}{0.122} = 1.82\)

Base \(\frac{K}{K} = 0.83\); Ideal **K** = \(\frac{0.233}{0.83} = 0.28\)

\(\frac{A_p}{\pi r_1 r_2} = 0.475\); Assume **r₂ = D/2**

Thus, **Aₚ = 0.475 × π × 0.061 × 0.111 = 0.0101**

Using **6** slots:
Slot width = \(\sqrt{\frac{0.0101}{6}} = 0.041\)
Slot area = **0.041 × 0.041**

Actual **r₂** = \(\frac{0.222 - 0.041}{2} = 0.0905\)

**Aₚ = 0.475 × π × 0.061 × 0.0905 = 0.00824**

Using **6** slots: each slot = **0.037 × 0.037** or **0.040 × 0.034**

Actual dimensions (EU44239):
- **d = 0.122**
- Swirl slots: **6 × 0.040 × 0.034**

## Design Considerations

1. **Orifice Length**
   Within reliable mechanical strength limits, the orifice length should be as short as possible. For small nozzles, a length-to-diameter ratio of **1:7** is satisfactory, but for larger flow numbers and wider spray cone angles, a ratio of **1:10** should be used. For example, for an orifice diameter of **0.140 in**, the length should be **0.014 in**.

2. **Swirl Chamber Cone Angle** – See schematic on **Page 10**.
   As the cone angle decreases, viscous losses in the swirl chamber increase, resulting in a reduced spray cone angle and increased flow number. Therefore, the maximum swirl chamber cone angle should be used while ensuring structural practicality.

3. **Number of Swirl Slots**
   Increasing the number of swirl slots improves spray cone quality. For flow numbers less than **1.0**, **2–3** slots are typically used; for flow numbers greater than **3.0**, **6** slots are used.

   Note: Swirl slot dimensions should not be too small to avoid clogging by solid particles in the fuel. Thus, nozzles with small flow numbers (<1.0) use only **2 or 3** slots to maintain dimensions ≥ **0.01 in**.

4. **Swirl Slot Housing Thickness** – See schematic on **Page 10**.
   If the ratio of swirl slot width to housing thickness is **greater than 1.0**, radial velocity components may appear, reducing nozzle efficiency. Therefore, the housing thickness should be greater than the swirl slot width.

5. **Materials**
   Use hardened stainless steel to prevent corrosion and reduce erosion. Hardened steel also facilitates the removal of machining burrs from swirl slots and orifices.

6. **Surface Finish**
   All fuel-wetted surfaces must be polished and deburred. All sealing surfaces must be carefully lapped.

7. **Tolerances**
   In addition to normal machining tolerances, grinding tolerances of **0.001–0.002 in** are required for the orifice and surfaces affecting fuel flow and spray cone angle to allow adjustment and matching of nozzle sets installed in the engine.

### (8) Clearance

To ensure smooth fuel entry into the swirl chamber, a clearance of **0.002 to 0.003 inches** must be maintained between the swirl chamber diameter and the edge of the tangential slot.

![Image of swirl chamber clearance](images/c77f6777cd2f023f943ea06c067b4130a601794413d02ccaad614380f3152a5d.jpg)

---

### (9) Concentricity

All nozzle diameters must be concentric, particularly ensuring that the orifice and swirl chamber diameters remain concentric.

The latest dual-circuit nozzle design for the Spey engine is shown in the figure. The rationale for selecting a dual-circuit design and supplementary design data are provided in **Appendix 2**.

### Appendix 1(a)

# Derivation of Formulas for Determining Orifice Diameter

When an incompressible fluid flows through an orifice:

\[
\Delta P_1 = D_1 = \rho \frac{V^2}{2g}
\]

\[
V = \sqrt{\frac{\Delta P \cdot 2g}{\rho}}
\]

Where:

- \(\Delta P\) = Pressure differential across the orifice (lb/ft²)
- \(D_1\) = Dynamic pressure head at the minimum cross-section of the jet (lb/ft²)
- \(V\) = Velocity at the minimum cross-section of the jet (ft/s)
- \(g\) = Gravitational acceleration = **32.2 ft/s²**
- \(\rho\) = Fluid density (kerosene density = **50.0 lb/ft³**)

Substituting known values into equation (1):

\[
V = \sqrt{\frac{\Delta P_1 \times 2 \times 32.2}{50}} = \sqrt{\Delta P_1 \times 1.288}
\]

\(Q_1\) = Volumetric flow rate through the orifice

\[
A = K \times A \times V = K \times \frac{\pi d_1^2}{4} \times V
\]

Where:

- \(K\) = Flow coefficient
- \(A\) = Orifice area; \(K \times A\) = Area at the minimum cross-section of the jet
- \(d_1\) = Orifice diameter (ft)

Substituting equation (2) into equation (3):

\[
Q_1 = K \times \frac{\pi d_1^2}{4} \times \sqrt{\Delta P_1 \times 1.288} = K \times d_1^2 \times \sqrt{\Delta P_1} \times 0.891
\]

When converting variables to commonly used units:

- \(d_1 = d\) (inches) / 12
- \(\Delta P_1 = \Delta P\) (lb/in²) × 144
- \(Q_1 = Q\) (gallons/hour) / (6.24 × 3600) (1 ft³ = 6.24 gallons)

Substituting into equation (4):

\[
\frac{Q}{6.24 \times 3600} = K \times \left(\frac{d}{12}\right)^2 \times \sqrt{\Delta P \times 144} \times 0.891
\]

Thus:

\[
Q = K d^2 \sqrt{\Delta P} \times 1670
\]

Orifice diameter:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{FN}{K}} \times 0.0245 \quad \text{(inches)}
\]

Effective orifice area:

\[
KA = K \frac{\pi d^2}{4} = FN \times 4.71 \times 10^{-4} \quad \text{(inches²)}
\]

---

### Appendix 1(b)

## Modification of Orifice Diameter Formula When Using Fuels Other Than Kerosene

Kerosene specific gravity = **0.8** (nominal value)

Let subscript \(R\) denote the liquid fuel used.

From equation (1):

\[
FN = FN_R \frac{\sqrt{\rho_R}}{\sqrt{0.8}}
\]

\[
d_R = 0.0259 \sqrt{\frac{FN_R}{K}} \sqrt{\frac{\rho_R}{0.8}}
\]

---

### Appendix 2

## (a) Rationale for Adopting Dual-Circuit Nozzles

The fuel flow rate through a nozzle is proportional to the square root of the pressure drop across the nozzle, i.e.,

\[
\text{Fuel flow rate (Q)} = \text{Flow Number (FN)} \times \sqrt{\text{Pressure (P)}}
\]

(where \(FN = \frac{Q}{\sqrt{P}}\)).

Engines requiring high fuel flow rates also demand high fuel pressures; otherwise, a high flow number must be used. The disadvantage of a high flow number is that at low fuel flow rates (e.g., during ignition), the fuel pressure is too low to achieve proper atomization.

**Example:**

Assume:
- Maximum fuel flow rate required = **100 gallons/hour**
- Maximum fuel pressure = **500 lb/in²**

Then, since \(FN = \frac{Q}{\sqrt{P}}\):

\[
FN = \frac{100}{\sqrt{500}} = 4.47
\]

Assume ignition fuel flow rate = **10 gallons/hour**

Then:

\[
FN = \frac{10}{\sqrt{30}} = 1.8
\]

The required fuel pressure at maximum fuel flow rate:

\[
\left(\frac{100}{1.8}\right)^2 = 3086 \text{ lb/in²}
\]

In practice, the maximum achievable fuel pressure is typically less than **1000 lb/in²** (approximately **700 lb/in²**).

In summary, a low-flow-number nozzle can achieve the required atomization at ignition but demands extremely high fuel pressure at maximum flow rates. Conversely, a high-flow-number nozzle requires acceptable fuel pressure at maximum flow rates but suffers from poor atomization at ignition.

Thus, a **dual-circuit nozzle** must be adopted to:

1. Reduce pump pressure.
2. Improve lean blowout limits.
3. Enhance relight capability.
4. Expand the engine’s operating range.

---

## (b) Supplementary Design Rules for Dual-Circuit Nozzles

A dual-circuit nozzle consists of two single-circuit nozzles arranged in parallel, one nested inside the other. The outer nozzle supplies the majority of the fuel, while the inner nozzle ensures good atomization at low flow rates. Both circuits are designed using the aforementioned methods, with the following additional rules:

1. The clearance between the main swirl chamber and the outer diameter of the secondary orifice should exceed the maximum dimension (including width and depth) of the main nozzle’s swirl slots.

   ![Image of clearance between main swirl chamber and secondary orifice](images/b8c12005f235134a0472a497dad20f03fc639ca36b2aca88822dff2b16cd5301.jpg)

2. The spray cone angle of the secondary nozzle should not impinge on the main orifice, as this would adversely affect combustion chamber performance.

   ![Image of spray cone angles](images/fb3b310d8e6656921ebac6440639c6ebbd2b78d331acab9dfb89843ff9c48782.jpg)

3. The main and secondary orifices must be concentric within precision limits, e.g., **0.001 to 0.002 inches**.

4. The outer contour of the secondary orifice tip must not interfere with the spray performance of the main orifice.

5. The Spey MK202 secondary orifice features six spray slots extending from the downstream surface of the secondary orifice to the end of the main orifice (see **Figure 6**). This design (known as the "miniature cage") stratifies the secondary spray to improve high-altitude relight performance. This feature does not affect the design rules for the secondary orifice’s flow number or spray cone angle (the spray can clean the slots).

---

## (c) Pressure-Limiting Valve Characteristics and Atomization

A dual-circuit nozzle essentially consists of two single-circuit nozzles. The inner (secondary) orifice has a low flow number, while the outer (main) orifice has a high flow number. The secondary orifice holes are positioned relative to the main orifice holes to ensure that the secondary spray does not interfere with the main orifice or its spray pattern. When the secondary flow reaches a predetermined value, the fuel system’s pressure-limiting valve opens, allowing low-pressure fuel to flow to the main orifice.

Although atomization is poor under these conditions, it does not severely impact combustion efficiency because the secondary spray’s energy is sufficiently high to compensate for the main spray’s low energy.

Factors contributing to good spray formation include:

1. Rapid expansion into a conical fuel film.
2. Turbulence generated by the relative velocity between air and the spray, which tears the fuel film.
3. Initial disturbances in the fuel film.

The most critical influences on these factors are spray velocity and initial film thickness. Film thickness is determined by the flow number and spray angle; wider spray angles produce thinner films.

For a given flow number, the most important control factor is spray velocity or nozzle pressure.

Assuming the secondary fuel flow direction is similar to or the same as the main fuel flow direction, the two sprays will combine their momenta.

Let:

- \(\phi\) = Secondary orifice flow number
- \(p\) = Secondary orifice pressure (lb/in²)
- \(q\) = Secondary orifice flow rate (gallons/hour)
- \(V\) = Secondary orifice spray velocity = \(K \sqrt{p}\) (ft/s)
- \(\Phi\) = Main orifice flow number
- \(P\) = Main orifice pressure (lb/in²)
- \(Q\) = Main orifice flow rate (gallons/hour)
- \(V\) = Main orifice spray velocity = \(K \sqrt{P}\) (ft/s)

Where \(K = \sqrt{\frac{2g}{\rho}}\) (assuming no losses in the orifice).

Assuming the same \(K\) for both orifices, the momentum equation is:

\[
K \phi \sqrt{p} \cdot q + K \Phi \sqrt{P} \cdot Q = (q + Q) K \sqrt{P_r}
\]

Where \(P_r\) is the equivalent pressure for the combined velocity.

\[
\phi p + \Phi P = \Phi \left( \phi \sqrt{p} + \Phi \sqrt{P} \right) \sqrt{P_r}
\]

Let \(\frac{\Phi}{\phi} = R\), then:

\[
\sqrt{P_r} = \frac{p + RP}{\sqrt{p + R \sqrt{P}}}
\]

The pressure \(P_r\) represents the equivalent atomization quality, i.e., the atomization quality of a single-circuit nozzle at this pressure. For a given \(p\), the minimum \(P_r\) occurs when \(\frac{dP_r}{dP} = 0\), or:

\[
\left( \sqrt{p} + R \sqrt{P} \right) = \frac{p + RP}{2 \sqrt{P}}
\]

\[
2 \sqrt{p} \cdot \sqrt{P} + 2RP = p + RP
\]

\[
RP + 2 \sqrt{p} \cdot \sqrt{P} - p = 0
\]

Solving the quadratic equation:

\[
\sqrt{P} = \frac{-2 \sqrt{p} \pm \sqrt{4p + 4Rp}}{2R}
\]

### Mathematical Formulation for Minimum Atomization Quality

The following equation gives the value of \( P \) that yields the minimum atomization quality:

\[
\sqrt{P} = \frac{\sqrt{p}}{R} \left( \sqrt{1 + R} - 1 \right)
\]

Expressed in terms of \( P \):

\[
P = p \left( \frac{\sqrt{1 + R} - 1}{R} \right)^2
\]

Solving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously yields the minimum value:

\[
\sqrt{P_r} =
\begin{array}{rl}
& \frac{p + R p \left( \frac{\sqrt{1 + R} - 1}{R} \right)^2}{\sqrt{p} + \sqrt{p} \left( \sqrt{1 + R} - 1 \right)} \\
& \qquad = \frac{2 \sqrt{p}}{R} \left( \sqrt{1 + R} - 1 \right)
\end{array}
\]

Under these conditions, the fuel flow rate is:

\[
\begin{array}{l}
= \dot{\phi} \sqrt{p} + \Phi \sqrt{P} = \dot{\Phi} \sqrt{p} + \frac{\Phi \sqrt{p}}{R} \left( \sqrt{1 + R} - 1 \right) \\
= \dot{\Phi} \sqrt{p} \sqrt{1 + R}
\end{array}
\]

Thus, for any combination of main and pilot fuel nozzle flow numbers and for any opening pressure of the pressure-limiting valve, the minimum value of \( P_r \) can be calculated. This value serves as the basis for comparing atomization quality. The fuel flow rate corresponding to the minimum atomization quality can also be computed.

This poor atomization condition is particularly relevant to high-altitude flight. When selecting the flow numbers for the main and pilot nozzles and the opening pressure of the pressure-limiting valve, careful consideration must be given to this poor spray condition.

---

### (d) Nozzle Air Shroud Design

Near the nozzle tip, the amount of air entrained by the fuel spray exceeds the air supply capacity of the nozzle air shroud. Consequently, contaminated air containing carbon and incomplete combustion products is drawn back to the nozzle tip. This process leads to carbon deposition on the air shroud and nozzle, distorting the fuel spray and further degrading combustion performance. While increasing the air flow through the nozzle air shroud is possible, this reduces the spray cone angle, potentially causing combustion instability. Although a wider spray cone angle can compensate for the reduction in cone angle due to increased air shroud flow, this compensation has its limits.

The influence of air shroud flow on the spray cone angle is complex. Lean blowout stability, combustion efficiency, and ignition altitude are all affected by this interaction between air shroud flow and spray angle.

For these reasons, the air shroud flow must be precisely controlled. Similarly, any new nozzle design should be based on experience gained from other engines. Flow tests should be conducted on the nozzle, and it should be tested in combustion chamber rigs to determine the appropriate air shroud configuration.

### Theoretical Calculation of Flow Coefficient and Spray Cone Angle

*(Excerpt from "Atomization of Liquid Fuels" by E. Giffen and A. Muraszew, 1953)*

This section analyzes a single-circuit centrifugal fuel nozzle. The liquid is introduced into the swirl chamber via tangential passages, resulting in a conical spray upon exiting the nozzle.

These calculations assume inviscid flow and neglect boundary layer effects. The flow is modeled as a conical spiral free vortex, incorporating both radial and axial motion.

The tangential velocity \( V \) satisfies the following condition:

\[
V_r = \text{constant}
\]

Where:
- \( v_s \) = tangential velocity at inlet passage
- \( R_1 \) = inner surface radius of swirl chamber
- \( A_s \) = inlet passage area
- \( Q \) = fuel flow rate

Thus:

\[
V_s R_1 = V_r
\]

And:

\[
\Delta V \Delta S = \frac{Q}{A_s}
\]

At radius \( r_2 \), the tangential velocity \( V_2 \) is given by:

\[
V_2 r_2 = \frac{Q R_1}{A_s}
\]

Within the nozzle (where radial velocity is zero), Bernoulli’s equation applies. Since total pressure is constant, the axial velocity \( u_2 \) through any cross-section must also be constant.

Where:
- \( u_2 \) = axial velocity within the nozzle
- \( A_2 \) = cross-sectional area of the nozzle
- \( a_2 \) = cross-sectional area of the air core

\[
u_2 = \frac{Q}{A_2 - a_2}
\]

The flow coefficient \( C \) of the nozzle is defined as follows:

### Mathematical Formulas and Theoretical Analysis

The flow rate \( Q \) through the nozzle is given by:

\[
Q = C A_2 \sqrt{ \frac{2 g P}{\rho} }
\]

Where:
- \( P \) = pressure drop across the nozzle
- \( \rho \) = fuel density

Consider the velocity triangle at an arbitrary point O on the exit cross-section of the nozzle. The radial velocity \( w = \epsilon 0 \), and let:

- \( u \) = axial velocity inside the nozzle
- \( V \) = tangential velocity inside the nozzle
- \( U \) = resultant velocity
- \( \alpha \) = helix angle

Then:

\[
\sin \alpha = \frac{V}{U}
\]

After leaving the nozzle at point O with velocity \( U \) in the direction OA, the fuel droplet continues in a straight line toward A. The resulting spray cone has an intersection line forming a cone with a semi-vertex angle \( \alpha \) at vertex \( O \).

Applying Bernoulli’s equation to the liquid flow from the inlet slot to the air vortex surface inside the nozzle yields the following relationship:

\[
P = \frac{\rho}{2g} \left( V_\Omega^2 + u_\Omega^2 \right)
\]

Substituting the values of \( \Delta V_2 \) and \( U_2 \) from equations (1) and (2):

\[
P = \frac{\rho}{2g} \left[ \left( \frac{Q R_1}{A_s r_2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{Q}{A_2 - a_2} \right)^2 \right]
\]

Substituting the value of \( Q \) from equation (3):

\[
\frac{1}{C^2} = \frac{A_2^2 R_1^2}{A_s^2 r_2^2} + \left( \frac{A_2}{A_2 - a_2} \right)^2
\]

Where:

\[
A_1 = \frac{\pi}{4} D_1^2
\]

Here, \( D_1 \) is the swirl chamber inner diameter.

\[
A_2 = \frac{\pi}{4} D_2^2
\]

Here, \( D_2 \) is the nozzle orifice inner diameter.

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{C^2} = \frac{\pi^2 D_1^2 D_2^2}{16 A_s^2} \cdot \frac{A_2}{a_2} + \frac{1}{1 - \left( \frac{a_2}{A_2} \right)^2}
\]

Let:

\[
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\bar{K} = \frac{A_s}{D_1 D_2} \\
\bar{X} = \frac{a_2}{A_2}
\end{array}
\right.
\]

Then:

\[
\frac{1}{C^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{16 K^2 X} + \frac{1}{(1 - X)^2}
\]

Assuming the formation of the air vortex maximizes fuel flow at a given pressure, \( \frac{1}{C^2} \) will be minimized. Thus, differentiating with respect to \( X \):

\[
\frac{d \left( \frac{1}{C^2} \right)}{dX} = 0
\]

This yields the expression for \( X \):

\[
32 K^2 X^2 = \pi^2 (1 - X)^3
\]

Substituting \( K \) from the above into equation (5):

\[
C = \sqrt{ \frac{(1 - X)^3}{1 + X} }
\]

From equations (6) and (7), a unique relationship between \( C \) and \( K \) can be derived.

### Nozzle Performance Analysis

#### Introduction
Fuel is typically injected into gas turbines via swirling jets. While all swirling jets operate on the same principle, performance variations among different nozzle designs are often difficult to estimate for those who have not been involved in the production of a specific nozzle model.

Figure 1a shows one type of nozzle construction.

**Figure 1: Nozzle Construction Types**

- **a**: General nozzle structure
- **b**: Swirl chamber length
- **r**: Tangential hole offset radius
- **D**: Swirl chamber diameter
- **S**: Return hole diameter
- **d**: Nozzle orifice diameter
- **t**: Nozzle orifice length
- **p**: Tangential hole diameter
- **Φ**: Swirl chamber cone angle

The nozzle consists of a main body and a plunger. The nozzle sidewalls have several flat surfaces to allow unrestricted fuel flow into each tangential hole when the body is tightened onto the fuel pipe. Figure 1b shows another nozzle construction type, where the orifice plate and plunger are inserted into the swirl sleeve, allowing fuel to reach two swirl holes. Detailed construction of this nozzle is shown in Figure 1c. Generally, fuel enters the swirl chamber through two holes of diameter \( p \). The swirl chamber can be considered a very short cylinder of diameter \( D \) and length \( b \), leading to a conical section with a cone angle \( \Phi \). Fuel in the swirl chamber exits through the nozzle orifice of diameter \( d \) in a vortex form. The mechanism of this flow has been explained (Taylor, 1950).

When the nozzle is in good working condition, a central air vortex forms, causing the fuel to exit the nozzle as a thin film with both axial and tangential velocities. Upon leaving the nozzle, the fuel disperses into a cone with angle \( \theta \). The surface of this cone gradually develops transverse waves and then breaks into ligaments and droplets (Squire, 1953). If the fuel pressure drops excessively or the fuel viscosity increases too much, surface tension acting on the cone can transform it into a tulip-like shape. In worse cases, the air vortex disappears, and fuel exits the nozzle as one or more ligaments, resulting in poor atomization quality.

Simons (1946) in an unpublished work indicated that nozzles perform satisfactorily when the dimensional parameters are arranged as shown in Table 1.

**Table 1: Standard Nozzle Dimensions**

| Parameter                     | Symbol | Relationship               |
|-------------------------------|--------|----------------------------|
| Nozzle orifice diameter       | d      |                            |
| Tangential hole diameter      | p      | p = d                      |
| Nozzle orifice length         | t      | t = 2d/3                   |
| Swirl chamber diameter        | D      | D = 6d ~ 9d                |
| Swirl chamber cylinder length | b      | b = 2d                     |
| Tangential hole offset radius | r      | r = D/2 ~ 3d/4             |
| Swirl chamber cone angle      | Φ      | Φ = 60° ~ 90°              |

Most of these dimensions are given in relation to the nozzle orifice diameter \( d \). In practical applications, the selection range for \( D \) and \( \Phi \) is quite useful. For the purposes of this document, a standard nozzle is defined with \( D \) fixed at 7.5d and cone angle \( \Phi = 90^\circ \), with the remaining dimensions as shown in the table.

### Fuel Flow Rate of Standard Nozzles

It has long been known that the fuel flow rate through a nozzle of a given shape depends on the nozzle dimensions, supply pressure, and the viscosity and density of the fuel. Dimensional analysis of this problem shows that if the parameters are represented by the symbols in Table 2, then:

\[
\frac{Q^2}{d^4 P \rho} = f \left( \frac{Q}{\mu d} \right)
\]

**Table 2: Parameters Controlling Flow in Centrifugal Nozzles**

| Parameter         | Symbol | Dimensions |
|-------------------|--------|------------|
| Flow rate         | Q      | M/T        |
| Pressure          | P      | M/LT²      |
| Nozzle orifice diameter | d | L          |
| Fuel density      | ρ      | M/L³       |
| Fuel viscosity    | μ      | M/LT       |

Preliminary tests were conducted on specially made nozzles using fuels of the same density but different viscosities (kerosene, hydraulic oil, and various mixtures of D.T.D 44D) and fuels of the same viscosity but different densities (kerosene and carbon tetrachloride mixtures). These tests confirmed that equation (1) accurately represents the flow through the nozzle. A series of geometrically similar nozzles of different sizes were then manufactured, and flow rates were measured for seven different fuels. These fuels were: (1) carbon tetrachloride, (2) gasoline, (3) kerosene, and (4)-(7) four mixtures of kerosene and hydraulic oil. The density range was 0.75 to 1.6 g/cm³, and the viscosity range was 0.5 to 25 centipoise. The pressure range was 5 to 1000 psi. The nozzle orifice diameters were 0.020, 0.030, 0.040, 0.050, 0.060, and 0.070 inches, labeled as nozzles (2) to (7). The measured dimensions of these nozzles are listed in Table 3.

During each experiment, the volumetric flow rate, temperature, and fuel supply pressure of the fuel were measured. By measuring the temperature, the fuel viscosity and density could be estimated based on pre-determined relationships between these properties and temperature. Thus, for each test, the following parameters were determined: **Q** (lb/hr), **P** (lb/in²), **d** (inches), **ρ** (g/cm³), and viscosity **μ** (centipoise). Although the units used are inconsistent, these are the units most commonly employed by those working with fuel nozzles in the UK.

For nozzles (2) to (7), the values of **Q² / (d⁴ P ρ)** and **Q / (μ d)** were calculated and plotted. The data points for each nozzle closely followed a common curve. **Figures 2a and 2b** show the data for nozzle (3) and nozzle (6), respectively.

- 7 parts DTD44D fuel + 1 part kerosene: △ (half-solid)
- 15 parts DTD44D fuel + 1 part kerosene: △ (hollow)

**Figure 3** shows the best-fit curve for all data points from the six nozzles. The values of **Q² / (d⁴ P ρ)** and **Q / (μ d)** have been converted to consistent units. The errors in measuring **Q**, **P**, **ρ**, and **μ**, as well as the assumption that **d** represents the dimensions of each nozzle, vary with experimental conditions. However, except for density **ρ**, the standard error of all measurements is approximately **1%**. This level of random error easily explains the scatter of the data points.

![Figure 3](images/c2d9d8217ab93b038576604818d809864fb57ebe275a8ce9085140665b4cc6e8.jpg)
**Figure 3: Relationship between Q² / (d⁴ P ρ) and Q / (μ d) (consistent units)**

Using the curve in **Figure 3**, the relationship between **Q² / (d⁴ P ρ)** and **Q / (μ d)** can be derived for any value of **d**. **Figure 4** shows ten such curves for **d** values ranging from **0.010 to 0.100 inches**, plotted on logarithmic coordinates. These curves allow interpolation to determine the orifice diameter **d** and other dimensions of a standard nozzle for a wide range of pressure, density, and viscosity conditions. When the values of **Q² / (P ρ)** and **Q / μ** exceed the range of the curves, the curves can be extended for applicability by dividing **Q / (P ρ)** by **10⁴ᵐ** and **Q / μ** by **10ᵐ**, while multiplying **d** by **10ᵐ** (where **m** is a positive integer).

Notably, for measured values of **Q / (μ d)** (in consistent units) around **1600**, the slope of the curves in **Figures 3 and 4** exhibits a distinct change. As **Q / (μ d)** decreases, the nozzle tends to malfunction due to poor spray formation or incomplete atomization. Only when **μ** increases to about **30 centipoise** does **Q / (μ d)** fall into the left region of the slope change. If both **Q / (μ d)** and **μ** are low, the nozzle fails to form a conical spray. For example, when **μ** is as low as **1 centipoise** and **Q / (μ d)** is below **1600**, the nozzle may not function properly. There is no clear reason why the curves in **Figure 4** cannot be extended to higher **Q / μ** values.

Interestingly, **Figure 4** shows that the flow number (typically defined as **Q / √P**, where **P** is in lb/in²) is not constant but varies with density, viscosity, and fuel pressure. However, since it remains useful, **Figure 7** presents the relationship between the flow number and the orifice diameter of standard nozzles. The fuel used was kerosene with a density of **0.800 g/cm³**, viscosity of **2.15 centipoise**, and a measured fuel flow pressure of **100 lb/in²**.

### **Effect of Nozzle Geometry on Performance**

To determine the effect of nozzle geometry on fuel flow rate and spray cone angle, a set of nozzles was fabricated according to the design shown in **Figure 1b**. The set included **31 swirl sleeves**, **9 orifice plates**, **1 plunger**, and **1 main body**. The swirl sleeves and orifice plates were interchangeable, allowing **279 different nozzle configurations**. The orifice plates had a cone angle of **90°** and a maximum diameter **D = 0.500 inches**, but varied in orifice diameter and length, as shown in **Table 4**. The **31 swirl sleeves** had an inner diameter of **0.500 inches**, with dimensions for tangential hole diameter **p** and offset radius **r** provided in **Table 5**. The dimensions of the swirl sleeves, orifice plates, and plunger were designed such that the cylindrical section of the swirl chamber had a length of **0.1125 inches**. The swirl sleeves were numbered **(1) to (31)**, and the orifice plates were numbered **(1) to (9)**. Different combinations were denoted by listing the swirl sleeve number first, followed by the orifice plate number (e.g., **27/8**).

For each nozzle configuration, fuel flow rate and spray cone angle were tested with a fuel density of **0.800 g/cm³** and viscosity of **2.15 centipoise**. A calibrated rotameter using the volumetric displacement method was used to measure fuel flow rate. The spray cone angle was determined by projecting the spray cone shadow onto a ground-glass screen, allowing accurate measurement of the spray envelope cone angle.

In each experiment on fuel flow rate and spray cone angle, the fuel supply pressure was **100 lb/in²**. Additionally, flow rate experiments were conducted on nozzles **(20/5), (29/7), and (31/8)**, which closely matched Simon's proposed design, at fuel supply pressures ranging from **10 to 200 lb/in²**. **Table 6** lists the experimental results for fuel flow rate and spray cone angle for all **279 nozzle configurations**.

### **Effect of Nozzle Geometry on Fuel Flow Rate**

**Figures 5, 8, and 9** present some of the experimental results on nozzle flow rate in graphical form. **Figure 8** shows the variation of fuel flow rate with orifice diameter when the tangential hole diameter is held constant. Within the range **d = D / 7.5**, the fuel flow rate is proportional to **d⁰·⁹⁴**. Similarly, **Figure 9** illustrates the variation of fuel flow rate with tangential hole diameter, showing a relationship of **Q ∝ p⁰·⁷⁰**. If both the orifice diameter and tangential hole diameter vary simultaneously, the flow rate **Q** is expected to be proportional to **d or p to the power of 1.64**. **Figure 5** confirms this result within experimental error.

For standard nozzles, based on **Figure 3**, when the fuel supply pressure is **100 lb/in²** and **d**, **p**, and **D/7.5** are approximately **0.067 inches**, the relationship **ΔQ ∝ d¹·⁰⁹³** holds. Thus, changes in the linear dimension **L** (which does not automatically vary with orifice and tangential hole diameters) cause the fuel flow rate to vary proportionally to **L⁰·²⁸**. The effect of nozzle geometry on fuel flow rate can be summarized by the following equation:

\[
Q = A \cdot d^{0.94} \cdot p^{0.70} \cdot L^{0.29}
\]

where **A** is a constant. This relationship is only accurate within a limited range but can be used to approximate the effects of changes in nozzle geometry.

### Fuel Flow Characteristics of Nozzles

This section contains 7 figure(s)/diagram(s). Below is the translated text, followed by technical descriptions of each image.

**Text Translation:**

**Figure 7: Variation of Kerosene Flow Number with Nozzle Orifice Diameter**

At a pressure of 100 psi, the flow number equals \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the fuel flow rate (gallons/hour).

**Figure 8: Variation of Fuel Flow Rate with Nozzle Orifice Diameter**

**Figure 9: Variation of Fuel Flow Rate with Tangential Hole Diameter**

Figure 6 presents the fuel flow rate versus pressure curves for three different nozzles. It is notable that the rate of change of fuel flow with pressure is very small.

Changing the fuel supply pressure can alter the nozzle flow rate, but practical difficulties limit the possible pressure ratio to slightly over 100:1, and the fuel flow rate to no more than about 10:1. Another method to change the nozzle fuel flow rate depends on the return oil hole in the rear wall of the swirl chamber. Figure 10 shows a typical nozzle structure with a return oil hole diameter of **S**.

**Figure 10: Effect of Return Oil Hole Diameter on Flow Rate**

By changing the pressure in the return oil pipe, the fuel return flow rate can be adjusted, which affects the nozzle output in two ways. When the return oil pipeline is opened to reduce oil pressure, the fuel flow rate through the orifice diameter **d** decreases, and the spray cone angle increases, even when the supply oil pressure remains constant. Thus, the fuel flow rate can vary by a ratio related to the ratio of the return oil hole diameter **S** to the nozzle orifice diameter **d**. According to Simon's method, Figure 10 shows the relationship curves of these ratios. Through (1) changing the supply oil pressure and (2) changing the oil port pressure, the combination of these two adjustment methods can vary the fuel flow rate by 100 times or slightly more.

### Relationship Between Spray Cone Angle and Orifice Diameters

Of particular interest is the variation of the spray cone angle with changes in both the discharge orifice diameter and the tangential port diameter. The spray cone angle increases with an increase in the discharge orifice diameter and decreases with an increase in the tangential port diameter. When both diameters increase simultaneously, the spray cone angle also increases. However, the measured spray cone angle curves exhibit certain inconsistencies, attributed to the difficulty in maintaining the required machining precision for each nozzle component. In particular, achieving satisfactory hole diameters on the order of thousandths of an inch is challenging.

**Figure 12** Variation of cone angle θ with tangential port diameter *p* for a nozzle with swirl chamber diameter of 0.5 in, offset radius of 0.198 in, and discharge orifice diameter of 0.077 in.

**Figure 13** Relationship between cone angle θ and simultaneous variation of tangential port diameter *p* and discharge orifice diameter *d*.

### Spray Droplet Size

The droplet size distribution produced by a centrifugal nozzle typically follows Equation (3):

\[
R = e^{-(X \sqrt{X})^n}
\]

where:
- *R* is the weight fraction of spray droplets with diameters greater than *X*,
- *√X* and *n* are constants determining droplet size and its distribution.

Needham (1946) investigated the relationship between the surface-volume mean diameter of fuel droplets and *√X* for Lucas nozzles of various sizes and shapes. He concluded that droplet size correlates well with \(182 Q^{0.25} / P^{0.4}\). The experimental results were obtained over a pressure range of 6–125 psi and a flow number range of 0.5–4.15. The study also examined the relationship between droplet size, flow rate, and pressure for an aero-engine nozzle with:
- Discharge orifice diameter *d* = 0.040 in,
- Tangential port diameter *p* = 0.028 in,
- Return oil port diameter = 0.060 in,
- Swirl chamber diameter = 0.2 in.

When no difference was observed between experimental conditions with the return oil passage open or closed, he derived that the droplet diameter (where the surface area-to-volume ratio matches that of the spray, also known as the **Surface Mean Diameter (S.M.D.)**) follows the relationship:

Upon re-examining these results, a more precise relationship for aero-engine nozzles with the return oil passage closed was established (Figure 14):

\[
\text{S.M.D.} = 325 Q^{0.318} / P^{0.530}
\]

**Figure 14** Variation of Surface Mean Diameter (S.M.D.) with fuel flow rate *Q* (lb/hr) and pressure *P* (psi).

**Figure 15** Variation of S.M.D. with fuel flow rate when adjusting flow via return oil port control.
- **×** Nozzle A
- **○** Nozzle B
- **△** Nozzle C
- **·** Nozzle D

For the same nozzle (△), Figure 15 illustrates the effect of opening the return oil passage on the ratio of:
1. S.M.D. of the spray with the return oil passage open to that with it closed,
2. Corresponding flow rate ratio.

Since Needham demonstrated that Lucas nozzles of different shapes and flow numbers fit Equation (4), it is reasonable to expect that aero-engine nozzles with varying flow numbers and shapes will conform to Equation (5). No other data on droplet sizes for aero-engine nozzles with the return oil passage closed are available. However, Joyce referenced three nozzles of nearly standard shape with discharge orifice diameters of 0.036 in, 0.050 in, and 0.075 in (hereafter referred to as Nozzles B, C, and D, respectively), yielding six measurements. Using Equation (5) to calculate the S.M.D. with the return oil passage closed, the ratio of S.M.D. with the passage open to that with it closed was determined and plotted against the corresponding flow rate ratio (return oil passage open to closed). This is shown in Figure 15. The close proximity of these points to the curve suggests that Equation (5) and the curve in Figure 15 can reliably calculate the S.M.D. for return-flow nozzles. Nevertheless, further experiments on additional nozzles are desirable. According to Joyce (1949), the S.M.D. of centrifugal nozzles increases slightly with viscosity, approximately proportional to the 0.2 power of kinematic viscosity.

### Conclusions

The results indicate that for fuels with sufficiently low viscosity (approximately 20 centipoise), aero-engine nozzles can be designed to provide appropriate flow rates, and the effects of nozzle geometry changes can be predicted. Similarly, when the pressure of the air into which the fuel is sprayed is known (1 atmosphere), the droplet size of the nozzle spray can be estimated. Further research on the effect of combustion chamber air pressure on fuel atomization quality and the atomization quality of return-flow nozzles (particularly for highly viscous fuels) would be valuable.

### Correspondence on Centrifugal Nozzle Performance

Mr. D.R. Carlisle, B.Sc. (Rolls-Royce Ltd.), noted that the first section of the author’s paper is valuable, as it confirms that for geometrically similar nozzles using various liquids, the flow coefficient \( \sqrt{Q^2} / (d^4 P \rho) \) is a single-valued function of the Reynolds number (*Q/ud*).

However, he did not explain how to design a nozzle to meet specific flow rate and spray cone angle requirements, although this is evidently the purpose of the work described in the second part of the report.

Among the 279 nozzles studied, most geometric dimensions exceeded practical requirements, obscuring some useful empirical relationships.

Of these nozzles, only 72 had swirl ports nearly tangential to the swirl chamber, and about half had a *D/d* ratio greater than 10. Evidence suggests that for an effective nozzle, *D* should not exceed 5*d*. Additionally, the discharge orifice length significantly affects the spray cone angle and pressure energy loss. For this reason, the orifice length should be as short as possible, ideally *d/5*.

Below is a summary of work conducted by his company on the relationship between flow rate and spray cone angle for centrifugal nozzles, along with a comparison of their results with the author’s nozzle calibration data.

### Relationship for Centrifugal Nozzles Using Kerosene (Specific Gravity = 0.8)

Taylor’s (1948) inviscid nozzle theory indicates that the flow coefficient *K* is a single-valued function of the parameter \(4 A_p / (\pi D d)\) (Figures 16–26), where *A_p* is the inlet area, and the spray cone angle is a single-valued function of *K*. In practice, as the author’s work shows, the use of viscous fluids alters the flow pattern in the swirl chamber, causing significant deviations from the ideal case.

**Figure 16** Flow coefficient *K* for 19 nozzles at a pressure of 700 psi.

Twenty nozzles currently in use were selected for testing with kerosene. Their flow numbers ranged from 0.1 to 0.15, and spray angles from 70° to 107°. Their geometries varied, with some featuring circular holes and others rectangular slots. Each nozzle was tested for flow rate and spray cone angle over a pressure range of 5–700 psi.

### Flow Parameter

Figure 16 shows the flow coefficient *K* measured at 700 psi, with the author presenting *K* as a function of Reynolds number *Re*. In Figure 17, *K* is plotted for each nozzle at pressures yielding the same *Re*, showing slight scatter in the results.

**Figure 17** Flow coefficient *K* at constant Reynolds number *Re*.

Analysis of the scattered points reveals that nozzles with high *D/d* ratios exhibit higher *K* values than those with low *D/d* ratios. Thus, Figure 18 presents *K* relative to the theoretical curve as a function of *D/d*, showing a clear trend. An average curve drawn through these points is used to correct *K*, and the adjusted values *K'* are plotted in Figure 19 (note: the *D/d* value on the ideal curve is 3.5). The scatter is reduced compared to previous plots.

Separate tests showed that increasing the swirl chamber length increases the flow coefficient. Therefore, Figure 20 plots the deviation of *K'* from the ideal curve against the ratio of total swirl chamber length to its diameter (*D/L*). This curve also shows a trend, and an average curve is used to correct the effect of *D/L* on *K'*.

**Figure 18** Deviation of *K* from the ideal curve as a function of swirl chamber diameter-to-discharge orifice diameter ratio (*D/d*). *a/b* is the ratio of measured *K* to ideal *K*.

### **Spray Cone Angle**

The spray cone angle is a difficult parameter to measure. At low pressures, after the disappearance of the tulip-shaped spray pattern, the spray cone angle gradually increases with pressure until reaching a maximum value. Subsequently, it decreases due to air entrainment. Different nozzles exhibit this maximum at different pressures. During testing, only the maximum value was recorded, regardless of the corresponding pressure.

![Figure 22](images/4ca5d81672348bd84d0b75d6b37b8b8e13a9aef86e6e7e3540dd4aa0e6bd2763.jpg)
**Figure 22** Relationship between measured spray cone angle and measured flow coefficient

Figure 22 presents the relationship between the spray cone angle and the measured flow coefficient. Research indicates a trend: nozzles with smaller orifice diameters exhibit smaller spray cone angles than those with larger diameters. However, the best correlation was found when plotting the deviation from the ideal curve against the product of the orifice diameter and the flow coefficient (\(K \times d\)). This latter function approximates the liquid film thickness inside the orifice. At constant pressure, it is proportional to the Reynolds number \(Re\), where the characteristic dimension is the liquid film thickness. The aforementioned curve is shown in Figure 23, and the corrected spray cone angle is presented in Figure 24.

![Figure 23](images/c082e2d28b1ab944d422ec06d53891e22d8fb0828dd03107e58b49d3cf6a8c8c.jpg)
**Figure 23** Deviation of spray cone angle from the ideal curve as a function of \(Kd/2\)

### **Design of Kerosene Nozzles for Given Spray Cone Angle and Flow Number**

From Figure 24, read the \(K\) value corresponding to the desired spray cone angle, then calculate the orifice diameter \(d\) using:

\[
d = 0.0245 \sqrt{\frac{FN}{K}} \quad \text{(inches)}
\]

Next, obtain the spray cone angle deviation from Figure 23. Using the new \(K\) value from Figure 24, recalculate \(d\). This \(d\) should be sufficiently close to the required value (otherwise, iterative approximation is needed).

If possible, the swirl chamber diameter should not exceed \(5d\). Use the shortest practical swirl chamber length, and obtain the correction factor for \(K\) from Figures 18 and 20. Using the corrected \(K\) (i.e., \(K''\)), read the value of \(4AP/\pi Dd\) from Figure 21 to determine the swirl port area. This defines all nozzle dimensions for the given flow number and spray cone angle, where the flow number corresponds to the flow at a pressure of \(0.5/d^2\) (which matches the Reynolds number \(Re\) selected for Figure 17).

![Figure 24](images/7082316e5a05b5908ea5b54e90cd0f9ef0a9e8b7dc90d5cffd60c770f4593667.jpg)
**Figure 24** Spray cone angle corrected to the ideal curve using the \(K \cdot d/2\) factor vs. measured flow coefficient

---

### **Analysis of the Author’s Table 6 Results**

For the nozzles compiled in Table 6, only those with an offset radius of 0.2 inches and exhibiting fully developed spray at 100 psi were selected. Most nozzles with \(4AP/\pi Dd < 0.1\) were excluded, as were those inconsistent with others, such as nozzles fitted with the No. 29 sleeve.

After correcting the spray cone angles of these 36 nozzles as shown in Figure 25, an excellent correlation between the corrected spray cone angle and the measured flow coefficient was obtained, as depicted in Figure 25. This curve is also included in Figure 24 for comparison with the author’s company results. It is evident that the author’s spray cone angle curve is \(7^\circ\) to \(17^\circ\) lower, due to two factors:

1. Differences in orifice length,
2. Measurement methods.

While the spray cone angle correlation is satisfactory, the flow parameter relationship is less clear. The flow parameter results are shown in Figure 26. It can be observed that each orifice size (or \(D/d\) ratio) has its own \(K\) vs. \(4AP/\pi Dd\) curve, qualitatively confirming the \(D/d\) correction in Figure 18. It should also be noted that all data points were obtained at 100 psi, preventing plotting at the same Reynolds number \(Re\). These families of curves remain useful but would benefit from further validation with additional swirl chamber diameters and Reynolds numbers. If \(Re\) is calculated using the liquid film thickness inside the orifice as the characteristic dimension, these curves might be consolidated into a single curve.

**Figure 26** Flow parameter: Author’s measured \(K\) values vs. \(4AP/\pi Dd\)

---

### **Further Comments**

As the author noted, the flow coefficient varies with pressure, but at higher Reynolds numbers \(Re\), it remains essentially constant, which is highly useful.

It should be emphasized that the corrected \(K\) values and the spray cone angle correction factor \(Kd/2\) apply only to kerosene. However, if treated using the true Reynolds number based on the liquid film thickness inside the orifice, the correction factor \(Kd/2\) could be extended to other liquids. Further work in this area would be valuable.

Exploring pressure losses within the swirl chamber of centrifugal nozzles is also meaningful, as these losses can exceed 50% of the total inlet pressure.

---

### **Remarks by Mr. R. H. Forsrer, B.Sc., A.M.I.Mech.E.**

In many centrifugal nozzles, care is taken to ensure that the outer edge of the inlet is precisely tangent to the swirl chamber to minimize inlet disturbances. In fact, the detailed data for the standard nozzles cited by the author were determined with this consideration.

It is surprising that the designs selected for testing largely deviate from this rule. Of the 279 tests conducted, only 9 adhered to it. The author is queried on whether this deviation has any impact. Conclusions drawn from small nozzle tests appear contradictory.

If the swirl radius increases, the tangential velocity \(U\) at the orifice increases according to \(U \cdot r^{2*}\) being constant. From Table 6, it is clear that as the cone angle widens, the flow rate slightly decreases. Without impact and frictional losses, increasing the offset radius would improve atomization. For the smaller nozzles tested, increasing the offset radius to a certain point causes the fuel cone to expand, but further increases prevent expansion, likely due to higher energy losses from the longer path traveled by the liquid at high velocity within the orifice.

Unfortunately, the author deemed it necessary to use mixed units. While it is acknowledged that centrifugal nozzle users in the UK predominantly employ such units, these nozzles are also used with other fuels, potentially requiring different units. Outside the UK, these units are difficult to apply.

In such cases, the use of dimensionless parameters should be discussed.

In the author’s units, the quantity \(Q^2/d^2P\) has dimensions of (pounds or grams) × (seconds² or hours²) × (centimeters or inches² × feet). Converting these units into a consistent system is not straightforward.

---

### **Remarks by Mr. R. P. Fraser, Dr. P. Eisenklam, Dr. H. Dombrowski, and Mr. D. Hasson (London)**

The paper provides highly useful data on two distinct factors affecting the flow characteristics of pressure nozzles. First, the author considers the influence of liquid properties on a set of "standard" geometrically similar nozzles (Table 1). Second, the effects of various dimensions of non-standard nozzles are examined (Tables 4 and 5). The use of the term "standard" may be inappropriate, as the centrifugal nozzle design employed has not been universally adopted by researchers or industry, and no true "standard" exists.

For non-standard nozzles, no relationship between fluid properties and flow coefficient was established, and the application of the design parameter equations (Equation 2) is limited because their interrelationships were not considered.

The spray cones of standard nozzles were not provided for various flow rates, making it difficult to determine the combined influence of flow properties and nozzle dimensions. The spray cone angle derived from flow theory represents the maximum angle obtained from the tangent to the conical liquid film surface (Figure 27).

The author and many other researchers measure the visual cone angle, which is influenced by spray curtain properties such as diffusion boundaries and droplet spatial distribution, rather than the theoretical spray cone angle. This measurement depends on ambient atmospheric pressure and can only be compared under similar conditions. When compared with ideal theory, anomalous results arise. According to ideal theory, the spray cone angle decreases with increasing \(p^2/2rd\), which aligns with Figures 11 and 12 but contradicts Figure 13. This discrepancy may be attributed to the higher flow number nozzles.

### Translation

The reduction in air resistance effects can be explained as follows: At this point, the decrease in spray cone angle is more than offset by the increase in droplet momentum, resulting in an apparent increase in the visually observed spray cone angle.

**Figure 27** Theoretically calculated spray cone angle

According to the author’s statement: Based on Needham’s results (1946), the equation (5) regarding droplet size is valid for different flow numbers and various shapes of fuel injectors, and thus should also apply to the nozzles under study. However, Needham analyzed sprays with cone angles nearly constant. Since the cone angle affects droplet size, and the author’s results show significant variation in cone angle, the use of equation (5) can only be approximate, especially at low pressures.

According to ideal theory, the flow coefficient \( K_{\circ} = \frac{\sigma}{\sigma \sigma \sigma \sigma \sigma} \) is essentially a function of the parameter \( \frac{P^2}{2 r d} \). For standard nozzles, the parameter \( \frac{P^2}{2 r d} \) is a constant value of 0.167. From the author’s relationship \( \frac{Q^2}{d^4 P \rho} = f \left( \frac{Q}{\mu d} \right) \), it follows that \( K_Q^2 = \Phi (K_Q \times Re) \), where \( Re \) is the Reynolds number based on the nozzle orifice diameter as the characteristic dimension. Thus, Figure 3 can be redrawn to show the flow coefficient \( K_{\mathfrak{Q}} \) as a function of \( Re \) (Figure 28).

**Figure 28** Redrawn Figure 3 to show the flow coefficient \( K_0 \) as a function of \( Re \)

At the lowest flow rates, \( K_Q = 0.66 \); whereas within the satisfactory operating pressure range of the nozzle, \( K_O \) varies between 0.4 and 0.25. This demonstrates that theoretical values are never achieved.

Based on comments made regarding Figure 4, namely that the flow number varies with pressure, density, and viscosity, this is also a result of frictional effects, as given by the relationship:

\[
FN = \frac{Q}{\rho \sqrt{P}} = K_{\circ} \frac{\pi}{4} d^2 \sqrt{\frac{2g}{\rho}}
\]

The flow number is determined by \( K \), and thus varies with Reynolds number, as shown in Figure 28 for the nozzles under study.

It is hoped that research results on the effect of friction on the flow coefficient of centrifugal nozzles of different designs can be published. This research was conducted in the High-Speed Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of the Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry at the Royal Institute of Science and Technology.

Mr. B·E·Knight (London) noted: He analyzed supplementary data referenced in the paper for Needham (1946) and derived an empirical relationship for droplet size (Sauter Mean Diameter, SMD) incorporating the effect of fuel viscosity, and also attempted to obtain the effects of surface tension and gas viscosity in dimensionless form.

The derived formula is:

\[
d = 220 P^{-0.468} Q^{0.209} \nu_L^{0.215} Sc R_L^{-0.216} W^{-0.115} Re^{-0.251}

- \( R_L \propto \frac{P^{1/2} F^{1/2}}{\nu_L} \) = Fuel Reynolds number;
- \( R_G \propto \frac{P^{1/2} F^{1/2}}{\nu_G} \) = Gas Reynolds number;
- \( W \propto \frac{\rho_G P F^{1/2}}{\gamma_L} \) = Weber number based on gas density.

These results were obtained using weighted average data from Lubbon and Bower (1948), which are consistent with test results from Lucas combustion chambers. Table 7 shows that for \( \nu_L = 2.3 \) centistokes, the Needham equation (Column A) and Equation 6 (Column B) data are consistent.

**Table 7** SMD (micrometers)

| P (psi) | Q (lb/hr) |       |       |       |       |
|---------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|         |           | 2     |       | 200   |       |
|         |           | A     | B     | A     | B     |
| 50      |           | 45    | 52    | 143   | 135   |
| 1000    |           | 14    | 13    | 48    | 35    |

In dimensional analysis, replacing \( F^{1/2} \) with nozzle diameter and \( P^{1/2} \) with velocity yields the well-known forms of \( S \), \( R_L \), \( R_G \), and \( W \). The practical selection of these variables is convenient both theoretically and practically, as it avoids introducing fractional powers of fuel density into the scaling factor. This scaling factor was omitted for ease of comparison with standard forms and because a complete discussion could not be provided.

Attempts to estimate the effects of surface tension and gas viscosity were partially frustrated because the precise relationship between \( W \) and \( R_G \) was derived from a small flow range. The corresponding exponents in Equation (7) are insignificant and can vary widely from maximum to minimum without affecting the data. Reducing the exponent of \( W \) to zero results in an implausibly large exponent for \( R_G \). When the exponent of \( R_G \) is reduced to zero, the expression becomes:

\[
S \propto R_L^{-0.211} W^{-0.257}
\]

Later private communications indicated that expressions (7) and (8) provide the influence of surface tension between limits.

The following example shows that Equation (6) provides a good representation of sprays from ordinary orifices used in diesel engines:

For \( P = 3520 \) psi, \( \nu = 5 \) centistokes paraffin spray measurements:

- Orifice length 0.4 mm, SMD = 21.3 micrometers
- Orifice length 0.9 mm, SMD = 17.9 micrometers

Professor H·P·Squire (London) noted: Measurements of fluid velocity or film thickness could provide further insight into the operation of centrifugal nozzles. Such tests could be performed using scaled-up models.

He advocated that future work in this field should use consistent units.

Mr. R·Wood, BSc, noted: The paper provides extensive data on the characteristics of nozzles of different shapes and sizes. Specifically, Figures 3 and 4 and Equation (5) are useful for calculating the performance of centrifugal nozzles. Unfortunately, many of the nozzles listed in Table 6 with their performance data are not typically used in practice. In some cases, the tangential hole offset radius is smaller than the nozzle exit radius, while in other extreme cases, the offset radius is often 10 times larger than the nozzle radius. Even standard-shaped nozzles have relatively large swirl chamber diameters, resulting in unnecessarily large wetted surfaces. The last column of Table 3, which shows the main dimensions of these nozzles, lists impossible tangential hole offset radii.

Regarding Equation (2), he was interested in the author’s explanation of the nozzle quantity (619). Its meaning is rather ambiguous, as if the purpose of introducing this quantity was merely to show that Equation (2) is consistent with Figure 3. Surprisingly, in the analysis of shape effects, one linear dimension of the nozzle—the tangential hole offset radius—was ignored.

Examination of the values in Table 6 reveals that for standard-shaped nozzles, \( Q \propto r^{-0.84} \). The effect of shape on flow rate is given by:

\[
Q = A d^{0.4} p^{0.70} r^{-0.84}
\]

Thus, there is no clear relationship between \( l \) and \( r \).

If the swirl angle is constant, then apart from nozzle length, the three dimensions \( d \), \( p \), and \( r \) can fully describe the nozzle shape. The significance of another linear dimension is unclear. He valued the author’s views on this issue.

Equations (2) or (9) strictly apply only to the author’s standard-shaped nozzles, and if the shape differs significantly, they cannot provide even an approximate concept of the effect of shape changes. For more practical nozzle shapes (\( d = 0.42 \) inches, \( p = 0.52 \) inches, \( r = 0.96 \) inches), the shape effect expression becomes:

\[
Q = A d^{1.2} p^{0.61} r^{0.24}
\]

In this case, the influence of the tangential hole offset radius is significantly reduced.

---

### Author’s Response

Mr. A·Radcliffe’s response stated: He thanked all correspondents. He had not realized that data capable of determining the influence of swirl chamber shape had been overlooked, as insightfully noted by Mr. D·R·Carlisle. He considered Carlisle’s method of using data to be a good approach.

He assured Foster that he recognized many of the 279 nozzles were impractical. They were used to demonstrate what happens with extreme designs. He agreed with Foster and Professor Squire that using consistent units is desirable and could be satisfactorily applied in Figure 3. Unfortunately, using consistent units elsewhere would make the paper difficult to read.

The author appreciated the precise insights from Mr. Frazer, Dr. Hisanklam, Dr. Dombrowski, and Mr. Hasson regarding the extent to which nozzle flow is governed by viscosity or friction. Undoubtedly, they and Mr. Hasson would agree that the inviscid theory (Taylor, 1948) provides unexpectedly good flow coefficients and spray cone angles as a function of \( \frac{p^2}{d r} \), although the internal flow in the nozzle can be well described by viscous flow (Taylor, 1950).

The author believed that, except near 0° or 180°, the cone angle is not important for controlling droplet size parameters and is best ignored. As Mr. Knight noted, many factors may influence particle size. Mr. Wood raised the issue of the parameter "l." It has dimensions of length and accounts for the influence of all other dimensions not varying with \( d \) and \( p \), including surface finish effects.

Here is the complete English translation of the Chinese technical document about the Spey MK202 aircraft engine, preserving all technical details, numerical values, equations, and structure:

---

### Ignition and Relight Envelope
On the state coordinate diagram, the ignition boundary line obtained from the test rig can be plotted.

This boundary line is then compared with the engine’s guaranteed relight envelope overlaid on the same coordinate diagram.

In the ignition test rig, ignition tests are typically limited to the high-altitude, high-Mach-number (high-M) region within the engine’s reliable operating envelope. Experience has shown that it is precisely in this range where starting performance is most sensitive to various local improvements in the combustion chamber.

Ignition and starting at the **P₃ = 14.7 psi (absolute)** envelope line (Figure 3) simulate ground-start conditions. These envelopes were obtained from a test article consisting of three flame tubes, with the central one equipped with an igniter.

---

### 3.2 Stability Characteristics (Figure 4)
The region to the left of the **P₃** pressure envelope line represents the stable combustion zone. If the operating point moves outside this envelope due to any of the following reasons, flameout will occur:

(a) When pressure **P₃** and air mass flow remain constant, a significant change in fuel-air ratio occurs; or
(b) When pressure **P₃** and fuel-air ratio remain constant, air mass flow increases.

Stable operation at a flight Mach number of **0.86** and flight boundary (altitude **70,000 ft**) corresponds to a point on the curve where **P₃ = 15.1 psi (absolute)**. The most severe possible flameout scenario assumes an instantaneous throttle closure, reducing fuel flow from maximum speed to idle without altering **M₃**, **T₃**, or **P₃**, and without the influence of a deceleration governor. Under these assumed conditions, during an abrupt deceleration from **70,000 ft** at **Mach 0.86**, the fuel-air ratio decreases from **0.0225** to **0.0168**, with a combustion chamber air mass flow of **0.59 lb/s per flame tube**.

Although the stability envelope corresponding to **P₃ = 15.1 psi (absolute)** is not included in the diagram, it is evident that the lean-stability margin is sufficient.

---

### 3.3 Combustion Efficiency Characteristics Across the Engine Operating Range
Figure 5 illustrates the relationship between combustion efficiency and the air/fuel ratio and combustion loading parameter **θ₃₀₀**.

To determine combustion efficiency at any operating condition, first calculate the value of **θ₃₀₀**, then read the combustion efficiency at the corresponding air/fuel ratio from the "carpet" plot.

For example, under typical ground-idle conditions:
- **θ₃₀₀ = 2.0 × 10⁵**
- Air/fuel ratio = **70**
- Efficiency = **86.0%**

---

### 3.4 Exit Gas Temperature Distribution
Figure 6 presents the temperature distribution measured at the exit of the gas duct, obtained from a single-sector combustion chamber test article simulating the engine’s maximum speed condition.

**Test No.:** 1133
- Mass flow = **12.06 lb/s**
- Inlet temperature = **787.5 K**
- Inlet pressure = **314.7 psi (absolute)**
- Air/fuel ratio = **51.9**
- Exit temperature = **1477 K**
- Exit temperature distribution factor = **22.8%**
- Radial temperature distribution factor = **8% (at 40%–60% blade height)**

### 3.5 Flame Tube and Gas Duct Wall Temperatures
**RLP3278** provides flame tube wall temperatures obtained from sea-level engine testing, measured using temperature-indicating paint.

The gas duct installed on the flame tube in this test was of an early standard.

Another diagram, **RLP4740**, shows the temperature of the current **MK202** gas duct under the same test conditions. This duct features two splash-cooling rings and five effusion-cooling air holes.

First Edition, September 22, 1976

# 1.0 Abstract

This report describes the development process of the Spey MK202 afterburner system from its first tests in 1956 to the present, analyzing the mechanical, thermodynamic, and aerodynamic issues encountered during this process. It also introduces the improvements made to the afterburner system to resolve these issues.

# 2.0 Introduction

The Spey afterburner system was the first fully modulated afterburner system developed for a British turbofan engine. The design principles were extrapolated from experience with turbojet engines, necessitating certain technical risks, particularly regarding predicted combustion performance. This report describes the problems encountered during the development phase and the testing conducted to achieve the required afterburner performance.

For the purposes of this report, the afterburner system is divided into three main sections:

1) Combustion chamber;

2) Mixer;

3) Ignition device.

The report also includes sections on combustion instability, specifically the well-known "buzz" phenomenon that first appeared during the development of this afterburner system. It presents the relationship between this instability and the fuel-air ratio used, and discusses the impact of "buzz" on combustion efficiency.

## 3.0 Development of the Combustion Chamber

The afterburner combustion chamber includes flame stabilizers that anchor the pilot flame, and fuel manifolds installed upstream of these stabilizers to supply the main fuel. The pilot fuel burning in the wake of the stabilizers is typically referred to as "wake" fuel, while the fuel supplied by the upstream manifolds is called "main afterburner fuel." The flame stabilizers were designed based on test rig results, as referenced in [1], and thus there was no prior engine operating experience to verify the performance characteristics or mechanical reliability of the stabilizers. Consequently, a key development objective was to determine the stability of the designed system under structural integrity constraints to ensure it could meet specified altitude requirements and operating ranges.

Problems encountered with the main afterburner fuel included poor fuel distribution or inadequate fuel preparation. During development, poor fuel distribution led to various issues such as "screech" combustion instability, low efficiency, and reduced achievable maximum afterburner thrust. Poor fuel preparation reduced combustion efficiency, thereby lowering the maximum afterburner thrust.

Thus, the afterburner combustion chamber had to be developed according to three different functional requirements:

a) Stability;
b) Fuel distribution;
c) Fuel preparation.

### 3.1 Stability

The flame stabilizers of the Spey afterburner system were designed based on test rig results, as referenced in [1]. The spacing and size of the stabilizers depend on the stability parameter (S), defined as:

\[
S = \frac{PWT}{V}
\]

as shown in reference [2]. While the stability for combustion with only wake fuel was well established by test rig experiments, there was no prior experience regarding the impact of main afterburner fuel on the fundamental flame stabilization characteristics. Therefore, it was assumed that the stability boundary of the vaporizer-type flame stabilizer (where pilot fuel is introduced inside the stabilizer) extended to the rich-side stability limit of the V-gutter flame stabilizer (where no fuel is introduced inside the stabilizer), which had been confirmed by both test rig and engine tests, as shown in Figure 1.

However, during early testing, combustion instability occurred at both sea-level and high-altitude conditions when fuel loading was high, limiting achievable performance. This instability, later termed "buzz," manifested as large pressure fluctuations, with amplitude increasing with fuel flow. These pressure fluctuations could cause mechanical damage to the turbine exhaust cone and afterburner combustion chamber. Consequently, much of the development work was dedicated to finding methods to avoid "buzz" conditions and achieve satisfactory performance.

Early tests indicated that the designed vaporizer-type flame stabilizers appeared fuel-rich at the inlet nozzles. Rig tests of segmented flame stabilizer components showed that fuel overflowed forward from the inlet nozzles, immediately creating a fuel-rich zone behind the stabilizer at the inlet nozzles, as shown in Figure 2. It was believed that the resulting intense flame could induce instability and potential local rich-quench, acting as a source of pressure fluctuations. This issue was resolved by increasing the outlet hole diameter of the distribution tubes to prevent forward overflow, as referenced in [3]. The resulting flame was significantly improved, but engine tests showed no noticeable improvement in the "buzz" limit.

Further studies examined the effects of various flame stabilizer geometric parameter changes, with particular attention to avoiding "buzz." These included stabilizers with notches to improve mixing at the pilot flame location and elongated inlet nozzles. The latter test was to verify the hypothesis that the inlet nozzles and distribution tubes acted as Helmholtz resonators, potentially tuning to standing waves in the afterburner combustion chamber. These modifications appeared to have no effect on the "buzz" limit or instability frequency.

Other tests to improve basic stability included redistributing the pilot fuel ratio among the vaporizer-type stabilizers. This was intended to ensure consistent "blowout" across the stabilizers.

Changes in pilot fuel pre-metering were studied from two perspectives. First, to optimize the "blowout" limit of the combustion chamber, tests were conducted at high-altitude conditions to determine the optimal fuel-air ratio. Simultaneously, the required pilot fuel flow for the best ignition characteristics was determined. To address the filling time and cross-flame propagation issues of the vaporizer-type stabilizers, it was found that the required pre-metered flow was higher than that needed for basic stability requirements, as referenced in [4], [5], [6]. Therefore, a compromise was necessary to determine the pre-metered pilot fuel flow value to achieve both good ignition performance and high-altitude stability.

### 3.2 Fuel Distribution

As with stability, the primary goal of studying fuel distribution was to overcome or reduce the range of combustion instability. It was believed that the simple straight-shot nozzles of the main afterburner fuel manifold, spraying downstream, incorrectly introduced fuel between the stabilizers, causing the pilot fuel to be contaminated by the main afterburner fuel, leading to premature local rich-quench in the wake of the flame stabilizers. In the initial design, the outer fuel manifold was located far upstream of the outer flame stabilizer. To prevent fuel from entering the heat shield annular cavity, a long fuel shield extended upstream of the manifold. One of the initial improvements was to remove the spray bars from the No. 4 manifold and move the manifold closer to the outer flame stabilizer, as shown in Figure 3. This arrangement reduced the need for the fuel shield, which was subsequently removed, resulting in reduced cold-state pressure loss and assembly weight. Combustion stability also improved, allowing the afterburner combustion chamber pressure to decrease by 2 psi, as referenced in [7].

Engine tests also confirmed that adjusting the spray position on the outer intermediate spray bars improved performance at maximum afterburner conditions, as referenced in [7].

Experience from this series of tests demonstrated the need for precise drilling of nozzles and careful control of the fuel injection direction from the manifolds. To achieve this, "target" plates made of annular flat plates were fabricated and placed at a specified distance downstream of the manifolds, requiring fuel to hit them. All manifolds underwent this test during flow calibration before being installed in the afterburner combustion chamber. Further improvements included moving all manifolds 4 inches downstream, moving the intermediate (No. 2) flame stabilizer 9 inches downstream, removing the spray bars from the inner intermediate (No. 2) manifold, and changing the spray angle and pitch circle diameter of the outer (No. 4) manifold. These modifications did not improve performance, and moving the intermediate flame stabilizer and manifold downstream actually worsened the stability limit.

Further redistribution of the main afterburner fuel during the development phase improved the maximum afterburner performance achievable before "buzz" occurred. This test clearly showed that the fuel from the No. 1 and No. 4 manifolds contributed most to "buzz."

The inner No. 1 manifold underwent extensive optimization testing after installing a catalytic igniter in the combustion chamber, as discussed in Section 5. This was necessary because "buzz" was encountered even at relatively low afterburner ratios. It was hypothesized that the blockage effect of the catalytic igniter caused a redistribution of airflow in the center of the combustion chamber, creating locally over-rich fuel zones. Shutting off the inner manifold increased the afterburner ratio limited by "buzz," but this also caused high-frequency (2 kHz) oscillations known as "screech," leading to mechanical damage. Tests were conducted with a reduced inner manifold flow (flow number = 8) as a temporary standard for the afterburner combustion chamber, achieving the desired "buzz"-free performance and minimizing the tendency to produce "screech" across most of the flight envelope. However, performance was still insufficient at the guarantee point of 36,000 feet altitude and Mach 2.0, requiring the inner manifold to be completely shut off to meet requirements. To overcome the "screech" issue, holes were drilled in the first three segments of the heat shield, as referenced in [8].

The downstream outer main afterburner manifold is located inside the diffuser. To ensure fuel is sprayed parallel to the airflow direction from the manifold and to prevent fuel from hitting the flame stabilizer walls, the manifold nozzles are angled. Tests showed that varying the angle between the horizontal axis from 6° to 26° had virtually no effect on performance. The current afterburner combustion chamber uses a nozzle angle of 13°.

### 3.3 Fuel Preparation

The goal of improving main afterburner fuel preparation was to increase the maximum afterburner limit. It was hypothesized that a circumferentially uniform fuel distribution could reduce local rich zones downstream of circumferentially discontinuous nozzles, achieving a fuel-air ratio distribution closer to that produced by an annular pump. This could serve two purposes:

a) If "buzz" is indeed caused by local fuel over-richness, then more main afterburner fuel could be supplied before "buzz" occurs.

b) Reducing nozzle size and thus improving fuel preparation could lead to higher combustion efficiency.

Such improvements were tested on both engines and simulated test rigs. Engine tests included increasing the number of nozzles on all manifolds while maintaining the original total flow number.

These engine tests showed that while some performance improvements were achieved with the 185 in² funnel mixer, no benefits were obtained when tested behind the finally selected slotted mixer. Simulated test rig tests, which only doubled the number of nozzles on the outer manifold (while maintaining the flow number), showed no performance improvement. This comparative test was conducted behind a 210-inch funnel mixer.

Initially, it was intended to introduce main afterburner fuel in separate circuits for the Spey afterburner modulation, a decision based on early design calculations regarding fuel boiling in the manifolds.

Approximately one year after testing began, sea-level engine tests proved that separate circuit fuel supply was unnecessary for this scenario. Subsequent engine and simulated rig tests confirmed that separate circuit fuel supply was also unnecessary under high-altitude conditions. As a result, the separate circuit fuel supply method was abandoned, and the separate circuit fuel valves were fixed in the open position. In early and current production models, the only function of the separate circuit fuel valves is to open and close during afterburner engagement and disengagement, respectively, to prevent fuel leakage.

## 4.0 Mixer

The initial Spey engines for the "Phantom" aircraft were designed with various funnel mixers, ranging in size from 165 in² to 230 in². Early engine and afterburner development demonstrated that a 210 in² mixer was necessary to meet specified afterburner performance at sea level with and without bleed. However, non-afterburning engine performance tests showed that a 185 in² mixer achieved better specific fuel consumption and higher non-afterburning thrust. Various tests were conducted to achieve velocity and temperature fields in the afterburner combustion chamber similar to those produced by the 210 in² mixer while maintaining the matching characteristics of the 185 in² mixer. These tests were insufficient to conclude whether changes to the mixer were appropriate. All such work was conducted on sea-level test rigs, with high-altitude performance derived only from Stage 12 bleed tests. The 185 in² mixer never underwent comprehensive comparative high-altitude engine testing.

Measurements of mixer cross-sectional parameters indicated that the more uniform the circumferential distribution of mass flow per unit area and temperature in the afterburner combustion chamber, the better the afterburner performance. This was the result obtained with the 210 in² funnel mixer. The reasoning was that matching fuel distribution with airflow was simpler using annular fuel manifolds. Additionally, circumferential variations in distribution could rotate to different positions under various flight conditions. Thus, even if the match was good at one condition, it could be completely mismatched at another. The 185 in² mixer indeed produced more pronounced undesirable distributions than the 210 in² mixer.

Simulated test rig tests of the Spey mixer, consisting of 20 slots, achieved significant improvements in maximum afterburner performance. Virtually no "buzz" was encountered. Further increases in fuel flow led to a drop in combustion efficiency, thereby defining the maximum afterburner limit. Therefore, a more practical improvement was made by removing the funnels from 10 of the Spey funnel mixers. Despite encountering "buzz" limitations, performance improved significantly. This was due to the mixer's circumferential distribution being more uniform than that of the 210 in² funnel mixer, even to a greater extent. However, unlike the annular mixer, the temperature and mass flow per unit area radial distributions of this mixer were relatively smooth. Both the slotted mixer and the annular mixer deviated from the ideal distribution due to sensitivity to bypass ratio.

Engine tests with the 10-slot mixer confirmed the simulated rig tests, showing improved afterburner performance in terms of afterburner temperature at the "buzz" limit. This was particularly evident at Mach 2. The additional benefit of this slotted mixer was that removing the funnels from the 210 in² mixer tended to return the engine matching to that of the 185 in² funnel mixer. Thus, in addition to improved afterburner performance, non-afterburning engine performance, specific fuel consumption, and thrust all improved. However, non-afterburning engine performance was still not as good as that with the 185 in² funnel mixer.

After removing the funnels, the connecting pieces or "ears" remained on the mixer. One test that cleaned up the mixer by removing the ears showed that without these ears, the "buzz" limit of the test rig engine worsened. Therefore, these structural features are still retained in current engines.

# 5.0 Ignition

The early design of the afterburner igniter consisted of a catalytic igniter assembly with a cone, installed outside the exhaust cone. Fuel was supplied upstream of the gas generator airflow. Ignition relied on the correct fuel-air ratio mixture flowing into the catalytic assembly, with the resulting cone-stabilized flame propagating downstream. The catalytic igniter was installed approximately 3 feet upstream of the afterburner combustion chamber, as shown in Figure 4.

This design had two serious flaws:

a) Mechanical failure;
b) Unreliability.

Although the catalytic assembly had a short lifespan when installed on the exhaust cone, ignition unreliability was the primary factor leading to redesign.

The arrangement of the catalytic igniter fuel supply system made it sensitive to swirl angle. Even small changes in turbine outlet swirl angle could cause significant variations along the exhaust cone surface inside the diffuser. Various fuel nozzles were tested over an extended period to overcome this sensitivity to swirl.

Test results led to relocating the catalytic igniter to the center of the combustion chamber, and this arrangement was engine-tested in January 1966. The centrally mounted catalytic igniter was further modified to include a venturi tube and dual fuel supply lines—one supplying fuel to the catalytic assembly and the other to a fuel manifold supplying the downstream catalytic igniter cone. An early version of the venturi catalytic igniter is shown in Figure 5. Later, it was demonstrated that this centrally mounted catalytic igniter or the catalytic igniter installed at the center of the combustion chamber proved to be mechanically quite reliable.

Early tests of the centrally mounted catalytic igniter supplied fuel from the inner main afterburner fuel manifold.

This arrangement had a very narrow operating range and was, of course, sensitive to throttle angle. At this stage, both the cone and catalytic assembly fuel were supplied by a single fuel line.

Subsequently, a venturi tube and cone fuel manifold were installed, and separate fuel supplies were tested for optimization. However, at that time, the catalytic igniter was supplied with fuel from the vaporizer-type stabilizer. This meant the catalytic igniter had to operate continuously during afterburner operation. Therefore, it was decided to supply fuel to the catalytic igniter via a timer, originally used for the exhaust cone-mounted catalytic igniter. This avoided mechanical damage and maximized the lifespan of the catalytic igniter. Supplying fuel via the timer did not compromise the performance of the catalytic igniter.

After initial development tests, a more practical design with a wider range of variations was prepared, and this standard catalytic igniter was tested. The tests showed that its performance was far inferior to the development standard, with a much narrower operating range and longer ignition times. Consequently, a series of tests was initiated to evaluate the impact of various structural changes on performance. Tests were conducted on engine components using an 8-inch model test rig.

1. Test results showed that the length of the fuel supply pipe was a major factor affecting catalytic igniter performance due to the influence of fuel boiling. Therefore, the purpose of the test rig tests shifted to studying a better catalytic ignition system, as referenced in [9].

Significant factors derived from these tests included the need to control the very small fuel flow through the venturi tube and to ensure this small flow was vaporized within the venturi tube.

The early-stage catalytic ignition system had no cleaning mechanism. Since the venturi tube fuel supply was regulated by a 0.025 restrictor, the reliability of the ignition system depended on this restrictor and the very small venturi tube nozzle working reliably, making it absolutely necessary to prevent clogging of the restrictor and venturi tube. Experience showed that without cleaning, fuel boiling and cracking occurred in the system when the catalytic igniter was not operating, resulting in gum formation that clogged these nozzles. Thus, the early-stage catalytic system was highly unreliable.

### Translation:

A simple purging system was therefore installed. Downstream of the check valve, there are two fuel supply lines. One supplies the catalytic igniter, while another with a comparable flow rate is directed to the nozzle petals, i.e., open to ambient atmospheric pressure \( p_0 \). When afterburner operation is engaged, fuel flows through both pipelines. When the afterburner is cut off, due to the pressure differential between the afterburner combustion chamber pressure \( P_8 \) and atmospheric pressure, fuel from the catalytic igniter returns to the purging line and is then vented to \( p_0 \). The performance of this system has been highly satisfactory and has been applied to current engines, as shown in **Figure 6**.

The catalytic ignition system is required to operate within the 3-second timer limit to meet technical specifications. The original technical documentation specified an ignition requirement at an afterburner combustion chamber pressure of 6 psi (absolute), equivalent to an altitude of 57,000 ft at Mach 0.9. This limit was not achieved, and the current standard specifies a reduced ignition limit of approximately 12 psi (absolute) afterburner combustion chamber pressure, equivalent to 40,000 ft at Mach 0.9. This reduction in the ignition limit is due to various reasons, primarily the predefined fuel supply schedule for the catalytic igniter and flame propagation issues. The aforementioned pressures are steady-state pressures with the nozzle closed. Due to the nozzle being pre-opened, the actual pressure at which the catalytic assembly ignites is approximately 1 psi lower than the above values.

Most of the development work on the Venturi-type catalytic igniter was conducted on an 8-inch diameter test rig. Testing demonstrated that the catalytic assembly could operate at the pressures specified in the original technical documentation. However, at such low pressures, the catalytic assembly was highly sensitive to the predefined fuel supply schedule. Additionally, the ignition time became excessively long. Consequently, if a timer was used, the fuel supply would be cut off before ignition occurred.

Extensive optimization testing was performed on the afterburner combustion chamber strut restrictor \( R_1 \). The flow rate through the catalytic igniter under flight conditions is determined by the afterburner combustion chamber strut restrictor and the check valve. Other variables examined included: the Venturi restrictor \( R_3 \), the size and number of nozzles in the fuel manifold, the inner diameter of the fuel manifold, the inner diameter of the Venturi throat, the size of the upstream plate holes, and the type of satellite tube.

The early production configuration was determined by the following key factors:

| **Parameter**                     | **Value**       |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Check valve rated pressure        | 200 psi         |
| \( R_1 \)                         | 0.036           |
| \( R_3 \)                         | 0.025           |
| Nozzle hole size                  | 0.03 in         |
| Fuel manifold nozzle size         | 0.039 in        |
| Number of fuel manifold nozzles   | 16              |
| Fuel manifold outer diameter      | 0.25 in         |
| Venturi throat inner diameter     | 0.25 in         |
| Upstream plate hole size          | 0.094 in        |
| Number of upstream plate holes    | 12              |

Bench tests conducted over a wide range of fuel pressures at pressures equivalent to afterburner combustion chamber conditions demonstrated that the predefined fuel schedule of the early standard was far from optimal. Significant improvements were achieved by reducing the check valve rated pressure from 200 psi to 120 psi. This allowed for higher catalytic flow rates and pressures under flight conditions. Additionally, increasing the fuel manifold nozzle size to 0.046 in and the afterburner combustion chamber strut restrictor \( R_1 \) to 0.04 reduced the fuel-filling time, thereby shortening the ignition time. Apart from later replacing the Venturi restrictor with a 0.035 in filtered restrictor, this configuration became the current standard. Combined with changes related to the predefined fuel quantity for the vaporizer stabilizer, the ignition altitude limit at Mach 0.9 was increased by 10,000 ft. This reduced the afterburner ignition pressure by 5 psi, resulting in a \( P_8 \) limit pressure of 7 psi (absolute).

The MK202 is required to operate with AVCAT, AVTUR, and AVTAG fuels. Most development work was conducted using AVTUR fuel, with occasional verification using the other two fuels. The primary issue with using these three fuels is the required Reid vapor pressure range for operation.

As previously mentioned, the normal operation of the catalytic igniter depends on fuel vaporization, particularly within the Venturi fuel circuit. Clearly, a wide Reid vapor pressure range implies variations in catalytic ignition performance. It can be expected that AVTUR and AVCAT performance would be similar. However, with AVTAG, especially at low afterburner combustion chamber pressures, ignition difficulties were indeed observed. The only effective solution to this problem was to use different control orifices, but this was beyond the scope of the study. Ultimately, a compromise standard was established to enable operation with all three fuels.

### **6.0 "Buzz" and Combustion Efficiency Correlation**

This report devotes considerable space to describing the difficulties encountered in achieving the required performance due to the occurrence of combustion instability known as "buzz." Therefore, during development, it was necessary to identify the factors controlling the generation of "buzz" and their correlations. Extensive practical experience has shown that low-frequency oscillations are related to the fuel-air ratio used, and the correlation of combustion efficiency is better represented by the air loading parameter than by the parameters used in the original design.

#### **6.1 "Buzz" Correlation**

Calculations of conditions with and without "buzz" ensure that the maximum allowable hot-core flow fuel-air ratio for buzz-free operation is shown in **Figure 7**. In **Figure 7**, it is assumed that 10% of the air entering the afterburner is used for cooling and does not participate in combustion (thus, \( 0.9 M_8 \) participates in combustion). The \( \frac{pWT}{V} \) parameter is based on the state at the stabilizer lip, assuming all stabilizers lie in the same plane.

Thus:

- \( p \): Static pressure at the stabilizer lip, psi (absolute)
- \( \Delta T \): Total temperature of the airflow at the stabilizer lip, \( ^\circ K \)
- \( V \): Airflow velocity at the stabilizer lip, ft/s
- \( W \): Stabilizer slot width, in
- \( \overline{F}_R \): Total afterburner fuel flow rate, lb/s
- \( M_8 \): Total gas mass flow rate at the afterburner inlet, lb/s

#### **6.2 Efficiency Correlation**

The performance achievable in the initial design was estimated based on the modified King's efficiency correlation \( \varepsilon_w \), as referenced in [10].

However, analysis of the afterburner performance of the engine under sea-level and high-altitude conditions led to the derivation of a new parameter, denoted as \( \theta \). Like the King's parameter, this parameter indicates that combustion efficiency depends on the afterburner inlet parameters, the fuel-air ratio used, and the combustion chamber geometry.

\( \theta \) is defined as:

\[
\theta = \frac{P_8'^{1.4} \times A_8 \times L \times e^{T_8 / 1000}}{M_8 \times \overline{X}}
\]

Where:

| **Symbol** | **Description**                                                                 | **Unit**                     |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| \( P_8' \) | Total pressure after cold loss                                                  | psi (absolute)               |
| \( A_8 \)  | Total cross-sectional area of the afterburner combustion chamber (Spey MK202: 1075 in²) | in²                          |

| \( T_8 \)  | Enthalpy-averaged temperature at the afterburner inlet                          | K                            |
| \( M_8 \)  | Mass flow rate at the afterburner inlet                                         | lb/s                         |
| \( \overline{X} \) | Flame spread distance                                                           | in                           |

Here: \( X = (1 - \beta) A L_G \)

Where:
- \( \beta = \frac{A_g}{A} \) (stabilizer area ratio)
- \( L_G = \) Stabilizer length (in) \( = \Sigma (\pi D_n) \)

The variation of combustion efficiency \( \eta_c \) with the hot-core fuel-air ratio (assuming 90% of air participates in combustion) and \( \theta \) is shown in **Figure 8** as a nomogram. In the figure, combustion efficiency is defined as:

\[
\eta_c = \frac{FAR_{RID} - FAR_{EID}}{FAR_{RHC} + \left( \frac{1 - \eta_E}{\eta_E} \right) FAR_{EID}}
\]

Where:

| **Symbol**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \( FAR_{RID} \)  | Theoretical fuel-air ratio required to increase temperature from \( T_1 \) to \( T_{HC} \) |
| \( FAR_{EID} \)  | Theoretical fuel-air ratio required to increase temperature from \( T_1 \) to \( T_8 \) |
| \( FAR_{RHC} \)  | Hot-core flow fuel-air ratio (calculated based on combusting air \( \times M_8 \)) |
| \( \eta_E \)     | Engine combustion efficiency                                                    |
| \( T_{HC} \)     | Temperature of the hot-core flow at the tailpipe                                |

| Combustion Research Report | CRR 12019 |
|-----------------------------|-----------|
| **Investigation of Spey MK202 Afterburner Combustion Stability** |           |

# 1.0 Abstract

This report summarizes the preliminary tests conducted by the Combustion Department to reduce combustion roughness in the Spey afterburner. The improvements tested included modifications to fuel supply arrangements, fuel distribution, and various types of vaporizer stabilizers.

None of these modifications significantly affected the combustion stability boundary, and no practical improvements were achieved from these tests. This report is published merely as a record of the work completed.

# 2.0 Conclusions

2.1 The design-type main afterburner fuel distribution creates a fuel-rich zone near the heat shield, resulting in localized overheating on the afterburner casing.

2.2 Reducing the fuel flow in the outer fuel manifold reduces the tendency for overheating and achieves a wider stable combustion boundary, particularly at 45,000 feet and 50,000 feet.

2.3 The second set of restrictors completely eliminated the occurrence of overheating and slightly improved the stable combustion boundary above 50,000 feet.

2.4 The modified No. 4 fuel manifold, with a fuel injector spray angle of **13°**, showed improved stability boundaries above 55,000 feet compared to a spray angle of **26°**.

2.5 The modified No. 3 fuel manifold without fuel injection rods had minimal impact on the stable combustion boundary, with a measured maximum difference in afterburner nozzle area of **20 inches**.

2.6 The modified vaporizer stabilizer with an **A_out/A_in** ratio increased to **1.5** had negligible impact on the stable combustion boundary. The maximum difference in area readings was only **10 inches**, but this stabilizer appeared to provide more uniform combustion.

2.7 Changes to the wake fuel supply and distribution only slightly improved the stable combustion boundary, and such effects are considered secondary for combustion stability.

# 3.0 Test Equipment

The tests were conducted from **May 25 to July 19, 1966**, in **Altitude Test Cell "C"**, Chamber No. 2, using an afterburner with serial number **H347**. The afterburner configurations tested are shown in **Figure 1**, with configuration numbers **12/1, 12/2, 13, 14/1, 14/2, 15/1, and 15/2**.

# 4.0 Introduction

In the Spey MK202 engine, combustion instability in the afterburner limits system operation near the maximum afterburning fuel flow required for full augmentation. The instability manifests as an audible "buzz" with a frequency of **100–120 cycles per second**. This instability occurs across a significant portion of the flight envelope at high altitude and sea level, particularly when **Stage 12 boundary layer control (BLC) bleed** is active. This report describes a series of initial tests conducted by the Combustion Department.

# 5.0 Test Objectives

The objective of the tests was to identify the primary factors causing "buzz" combustion under high-altitude conditions, with the goal of eliminating "buzz" entirely at or beyond (if possible) the maximum afterburning fuel flow required for full augmentation. The target fuel flow, or the flow at which "buzz" does not occur, must also align with achieving the required augmentation ratio and satisfactory combustion efficiency.

The tests primarily investigated the effects of the following factors:

a) Fuel distribution ratios among the main fuel manifolds
b) Changes in fuel injection location
c) Types of vaporizer stabilizers
d) Changes in spray angle on the outer fuel manifold

# 6.0 Test Rig Description

The test rig is shown in **Figure 2** and uses an altitude chamber to simulate high-altitude conditions by reducing pressure.

The afterburner is connected to a simulation device consisting of six **Avon** combustion chambers as preheaters and an outer bypass airflow simulating engine bypass outlet conditions. Air is supplied to the simulation device by a supply compressor and extracted from the altitude chamber by six exhaust compressors. The rig includes the same type of mixer and transition section as the engine. Thus, the tested afterburner experiences similar pressure, temperature, and airflow velocity conditions as in the engine, except that swirl effects present in the engine cannot be simulated on the test rig.

The ducting, test chamber, and simulation device are equipped with comprehensive measurement and control systems, enabling precise simulation of flight conditions across a wide range of Mach number/altitude combinations.

# 7.0 Test Procedure

Initially, the test rig was adjusted to achieve specified values of **p_i** and **p₀** (Table I) to establish conditions at **45,000 feet** and **Mach number 1.53**. The **T₆** temperature was adjusted to its specified value using a maximum temperature controller, while **T₁** was allowed to stabilize at **150°C**. The afterburner was then ignited using a catalytic igniter mounted on the tail cone of the simulation device, with fuel initially supplied only to the vaporizer stabilizer. Subsequently, the main afterburner fuel flow was increased via the manifold valves to the maximum predetermined fuel flow for the specific altitude. At this point, the automatic data acquisition system scanned and recorded the primary parameters. If the parameters determining the afterburner Mach number, **M√T / S503**, and bypass ratio were within the limits specified in **Table II**, the parameters were recorded, and a set of readings was obtained. If combustion instability occurred before reaching the maximum predetermined main afterburner fuel flow, the fuel flow was reduced to just below the instability threshold, and readings were recorded. If no instability occurred at the maximum predetermined fuel flow, the fuel flow was increased by **15%**, and the automatic data acquisition system recorded another set of readings. Whenever the nozzle reached its maximum open position (i.e., contacted the stop), the main afterburner fuel flow was no longer increased, and readings were recorded.

During adjustments, the afterburner inlet **Q**-parameter and bypass ratio were maintained within the following limits:

\[
169 \leq \frac{M \sqrt{T}}{S503} \leq 171
\]

\[
0.835 \leq \mu \leq 0.865
\]

The tests were repeated for different altitudes as shown in **Table I**. Combustion instability was detected using the following methods:

1. Ultraviolet recorder oscilloscope displaying fluctuations in **S503** and vaporizer stabilizer fuel pressure.
2. Audible "buzz" monitoring via the observation port.
3. Vibration meter on the control console, connected to sensors mounted on the afterburner.

However, during testing, the ultraviolet recorder was used as the sole method to indicate the occurrence of unstable combustion, and the onset of unstable combustion was detected by a sudden increase in the amplitude of S503 pressure fluctuations.

### 8.0 Operating Conditions

The test rig was adjusted to simulate the Spey MK202 operating at a Mach number of 1.53 with a bypass ratio of 0.85 on the low-working line. Strictly speaking, this is not a real operating condition but was used as a slightly more severe condition than those encountered by the engine.

---

### 9.0 Results Discussion

#### 9.1 Test Results Representation

The test results are presented as curves showing the relationship between nozzle area and altitude at the onset of unstable combustion or at maximum predetermined fuel flow (Figures 3 to 7). Recent tests have used the ratio of afterburner to non-afterburner nozzle area or the calculated average nozzle temperature to represent results. In earlier tests, the automatic data recording equipment did not have the capability to calculate the non-afterburner nozzle area.

#### 9.2 Effect of Fuel Distribution Ratio

The first phase of tests aimed to determine the effect of changing the fuel distribution ratio among the fuel manifolds. The distribution ratio was altered by installing restrictors in the main afterburner fuel supply lines. The restrictors were grouped into three sets, with the corresponding fuel distribution ratios shown in the table below:

Configuration 12/1 supplied fuel according to the design fuel distribution ratio, resulting in hot zones on the afterburner combustion chamber casing due to the higher percentage of fuel supplied by the No. 4 manifold, causing combustion near the heat shield. The nozzle area achieved with this configuration is shown in Figure 3.

Using the first set of restrictors reduced the fuel supply ratio of the No. 4 manifold from 30.3% to 27.2%, nearly eliminating the hot zones. This improvement also slightly increased the nozzle opening at lower altitudes, as shown in Configuration 12/2 in Figure 3.

| Supply Zone | 1 (Innermost) | 2 | 3 | 4 (Outermost) |
|-------------|---------------|---|---|---------------|
| Group 1 | 6.6% | 26.4% | 39.8% | 27.2% |
| Group 2 | 6.3% | 28.4% | 41.0% | 24.3% |
| Group 3 | 7.0% | 32.2% | 48.6% | 12.2% |
| Design Distribution | 6.7% | 24.7% | 38.3% | 30.3% |

Even with this fuel distribution ratio, there was still a tendency to produce hot zones.

It appears that using the second set of restrictors to further reduce the fuel supply ratio of the No. 4 manifold from 27.2% to 24.3% completely eliminated the hot zones. This arrangement slightly widened the stable combustion boundary at higher altitudes compared to Configuration 12/2, as shown in Configuration 14/2 in Figure 4. Configuration 15/2 shows that the third set of restrictors provided a slightly better stable combustion boundary than the second set, as shown in Figure 5.

#### 9.3 Effect of Injection Angle

Configuration 13 in Figure 3 shows that the improved No. 4 manifold with a 13° injection angle slightly improved the stable combustion boundary compared to Configuration 12/2 with a 26° injection angle.

#### 9.4 Effect of Changing Vaporizer Stabilizer Fuel Flow

Configuration 14/2 was used to evaluate the effect of changing the vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow on the "buzz" boundary. At 55,000 feet, the "buzz" boundary was found using the normal method of controlling the vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow and increasing the main manifold fuel flow. The main manifold fuel flow was then reduced until the "buzz" disappeared. The vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow was readjusted stepwise to ±43% of the standard flow rate (i.e., ±60 gal/h). The main manifold fuel flow was then increased again using the normal method until the "buzz" boundary was reached. The test results shown in Figure 4 indicate that a slightly higher vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow can achieve better "buzz" margin. Therefore, it can be concluded that for this altitude/Mach number combination, the original vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow was not optimal. This was not verified at other altitudes.

#### 9.5 Effect of Fuel Supply Arrangement

The comparison between Configurations 14/2 and 15/1 in Figure 6 shows that removing the spray bars on the No. 3 manifold and redrilling holes in the manifold had no significant effect on combustion stability.

#### 9.6 Effect of Changing the Vaporizer Stabilizer

A vaporizer stabilizer with an area ratio (A_in/A_out) of 1 (where A_in = inlet area of the air intake nozzle before the stabilizer, A_out = outlet area of the air and fuel holes on the distribution tube) was found to cause fuel overflow around the intake nozzle. Tests on a small-scale test rig showed that this created a rich fuel flame behind the intake nozzle, while the flames toward each end of the distribution tube became weaker. Tests on the outlet-opening test rig also found that for low $C_D$ values, increasing the outlet area resulted in a relatively stable blue flame around the stabilizer. After increasing the area, the area ratio (A_out/A_in) = 1.5. However, the comparison between Configurations 13 and 14/1 in Figure 7 shows that this relatively stable flame did not significantly improve the stable combustion boundary.

#### 9.7 Afterburner Efficiency

To estimate afterburner efficiency, curves of nozzle position indicator angle versus total fuel flow and total airflow were plotted (Figure 8). In the absence of non-afterburner nozzle area data, this form of plot was necessary. The plot shows that for these test configurations, the nozzle area (and thus afterburner temperature) increases with increasing fuel flow, indicating that combustion efficiency either increases or at least does not decrease with increasing fuel flow. The curves also show that for each configuration, as the restrictors change from Group 1 to Group 2 to Group 3, the nozzle area (and thus efficiency) tends to decrease. Unfortunately, this trend of decreasing nozzle area coincides with the trend of moving away from "buzz" shown in previous plots, so we can conclude that expanding the stable combustion boundary comes at the cost of some afterburner efficiency.

#### 9.8 Effect of Manifold Valve

Except for one test in Configuration 15/2 where the manifold valve was fixed in the open position, all other tests were conducted with the manifold valve operating normally. Nozzle position indicator angles were recorded at different fuel-air ratios and plotted in Figure 8. The figure shows that within the test range, as the manifold fuel flow increased, efficiency remained clearly constant.

### **Translation of Main Text**

#### **Introduction**
Since November 1966, extensive **afterburner ignition tests** of the **Spey afterburner system** have been conducted on the **altitude test facility**.

Early tests used a **development-type catalytic igniter** centrally mounted in the afterburner. Later (post-April 1967), a **production-type igniter** was adopted. Testing ultimately achieved **reliable ignition at 40,000 ft, Mach 0.9**, meeting early operational standards.

This report aims to:
1. Summarize key results obtained with the **production-type catalytic igniter**.
2. Report engine test results under **early operational standards**.
3. Identify further improvements needed for the **afterburner system and catalytic igniter** to meet technical requirements.

---

#### **Conclusions**
1. The **early operational afterburner** achieved reliable ignition at **40,000 ft, Mach 0.9** with **nominal vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow**.
2. Increasing **total vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow** at high altitude improved afterburner ignition performance via:
   - **(a) Reduced fuel-filling time** – At **52,000 ft, Mach 0.9**, fuel-filling time decreased from **2.3 s to 1.3 s** with increased vaporizer flow.
   - **(b) Improved flame propagation** – Flame transfer time from **inner to outer stabilizers** reduced from **3.5 s (nominal flow) to 0.1 s (increased flow)** at **52,000 ft, Mach 0.9**.
   - **(c) Enhanced ignition capability**.
3. This report details the **minimum vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow** required for **effective flame propagation**.
4. **(a)** Above **40,000 ft, Mach 0.9**, the **catalytic igniter fuel ring** operates **below its known lean limit**, verified by **test rig and engine trials**.
   **(b)** At **52,000 ft, Mach 0.9**, a **minimum fuel ring flow of 20 gal/hr** is required for **stable catalytic igniter flame** (current design provides only **~5 gal/hr**).
5. The **catalytic igniter Venturi fuel system** operates **above its known rich limit**, with a **0.025 in. restrictor** upstream of the Venturi nozzle acting as a buffer.
6. **Ignition capability of early-production engines** varies with **vaporizer stabilizer flow changes**.
7. Increasing **vaporizer stabilizer or fuel ring flow** enables **ignition within ~2 s** up to **52,000 ft, Mach 0.9**.

---

#### **Next Steps**
1. Use an **afterburner regulator with increased vaporizer flow** to improve **ignition and flame propagation** (available August 1967).
2. Increase **fuel ring flow** via an **enlarged external restrictor** to maintain **current catalytic igniter flow**.
3. Determine **lean/rich limits** of the **catalytic igniter and fuel ring** at **sea level**.
4. Conduct **afterburner ignition tests above 52,000 ft, Mach 0.9** once **engine inlet pressure (P₁) limits** are removed.
5. Further study the **catalytic igniter fuel system**.

---

#### **Preface**
Since November 1966, extensive **afterburner ignition tests** have been conducted on the **altitude test facility** to evaluate the **centrally mounted catalytic igniter system**.

Early tests used a **development-type catalytic igniter**, achieving **fully automatic afterburner ignition at 52,000 ft, Mach 0.9 in 14 s**. The excessive delay was due to **poor flame propagation from inner to outer stabilizers**.

Subsequent **sea-level tests** of the **early production-type catalytic igniter** were **unsuccessful**, requiring extensive combustion testing to identify **inherent fuel supply faults**.

From April 1967 onward, further **engine tests** were conducted on the **altitude test facility** using a **modified catalytic igniter** with a **"parallel" fuel supply system** (similar to the development-type), feeding both the **Venturi and fuel ring**.

This report summarizes **key results** from later **production-type catalytic igniter tests** and recommends **further afterburner improvements** to meet current ignition requirements.

- **Ignition attempts at min afterburner thrust with varying vaporizer flow**:
  - **Below nominal vaporizer flow (214 gal/hr)**, **ignition time increased significantly** due to **poor flame propagation**.

- **Total vaporizer flow > 180 gal/hr required for instantaneous flame propagation**.
- **210 gal/hr (53.7% above nominal) considered minimum for fast ignition at this altitude**.
- **Further tests with varying fuel ring flow (Venturi & stabilizer flow constant)**:
  - **Increasing fuel ring flow reduced ignition time** (max tested: **40 gal/hr** due to auxiliary fuel supply limits).
  - **Increasing Venturi flow to 0.00052 lb/s had negligible effect** except at **higher stabilizer flows (ignition time increased to 1.25 s)**.

### Test 15 (a) and (b), 24 May 1967 – 6 June 1967, Engine 41 with Afterburner H366 (Early Production Engine) (Refer to Figure RHD1023)

Since the current control system does not permit the total vaporizer stabilizer flow number to exceed 30, it is necessary to redistribute the vaporizer stabilizer fuel to increase the flow to the inner-ring vaporizer stabilizer—an area likely favorable for ignition.

This test configuration included a vaporizer stabilizer with an increased fuel flow rate (+75%) and was of the general early production type (Refer to Figure RHD1023).

At 50,000 feet, Mach 0.9 (P₈ = 8.5 psia), consistent ignition was achieved, although the ignition time was 7–8 seconds. However, ignition observations indicated that the inner-ring vaporizer stabilizer ignited 2.5–3.0 seconds after afterburner activation. At this altitude, before optimizing the total vaporizer stabilizer flow, this ignition device exhibited the same ignition characteristics as those obtained in Test 14 (Engine 20006 and Afterburner H348).

To rapidly ignite the combustion chamber, further increasing the total vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow is necessary.

### Test 16 (A), 6 June 1967, Engine 43 with Afterburner AU6 (Refer to Figure RHD1023)

Although this configuration was of the early production type, like Engine 41, the consistent ignition limit was only 38,500 feet at Mach 0.9 (P₈ = 14.1 psia). Further investigation revealed that the vaporizer stabilizer’s predetermined flow rate was below the nominal value, and it was confirmed that when the vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply was low, ignition characteristics deteriorated.

### Test 16 (B), 9 June 1967, Engine 43 with Afterburner AU6

The configuration was identical to Test 16 (A), but with a steatite cup-shaped catalyst. Only limited ignition tests were conducted, and it appeared that this catalyst provided little or no improvement to ignition.

### Test 17, 17 June 1967, Engine 507 with Afterburner H370 (Refer to Figure RHD1023)

Apart from a 6-second catalytic igniter timer and artificially increased afterburner fuel flow (achieved by mechanically locking the P₃ splitter in the open position), the afterburner configuration was the same as in Tests 15 and 16, belonging to the early production type.

At 52,000 feet, Mach 0.9 (P₈ = 7.65 psia), successful ignition was achieved within 4–5 seconds after afterburner activation, despite the vaporizer stabilizer and catalytic igniter fuel pressures being zero for the first 1.5 seconds. At this condition, flame propagation was nearly instantaneous (1/10 second). Visual inspection in the test cell could not identify the ignition status of individual vaporizer stabilizers.

Above this altitude, due to the engine inlet pressure P₁ being limited to 5 psia, afterburner ignition could not be achieved.

### Discussion of Results

#### (1) Centrally Mounted Catalytic Igniter in the Afterburner Design – With Parallel Fuel Supply System

Initially, the early design could ignite up to 30,000 feet at Mach 0.9, but flow test results compared with previously established test limits indicated that the catalytic igniter was operating beyond its known rich-fuel limit. To mitigate this issue, a 0.025-inch diameter restrictor was installed upstream of the Venturi nozzle to "buffer" the catalytic igniter fuel flow. This modification enabled ignition of the combustion chamber at 35,500 feet, Mach 0.9 (2.6 seconds). However, due to subsequent engine malfunctions, testing at higher altitudes was not possible.

Installing the 0.025-inch restrictor improved in-flight ignition limits by approximately 5,000 feet.

#### (2) Centrally Mounted Catalytic Igniter in the Afterburner Design – With Auxiliary Fuel System Supplying the Catalytic Igniter and Fuel Manifold

##### (a) Early tests were conducted with standard vaporizer stabilizer fuel distribution and a 0.035-inch central orifice supplying the catalytic igniter fuel system.

When the catalytic igniter was continuously fueled (but the fuel manifold was not), it was possible to maintain a stable catalytic igniter flame beyond its known rich-fuel limit. Clearly, when fuel was excessive, the catalytic igniter exceeded its rich-fuel boundary, and the excess fuel acted as a supply for the fuel manifold. Therefore, when using the catalytic igniter system, it is crucial to ensure that the catalytic igniter fuel supply is within the limit range to achieve successful reignition. Although only catalytic igniter fuel could ignite the combustion chamber at 36,000 feet, Mach 0.9, without supplying fuel to the fuel manifold, the ignition time was too long to be practically feasible.

Above this altitude, flame propagation typically required 3–4 seconds. Although increasing the fuel manifold supply reduced this time delay, the inner-ring stabilizer ignition time still depended on the time required to establish the overall vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow—approximately 3 seconds at 45,000 feet, Mach 0.9—but this could be significantly improved by several vaporizer stabilizer fuel-filling patterns.

##### (b) Subsequent tests were conducted with a 0.07-inch side nozzle in the Venturi wall and standard vaporizer stabilizer fuel distribution. The ignition times obtained were worse than in (a), and above 40,000 feet (Mach 0.9), ignition failed completely. Since the catalytic igniter flame was established before activation, poor ignition was due to the nominal flow matching of the vaporizer stabilizer. Thus, when the fuel manifold supply was increased to obtain a stronger and more stable catalytic igniter flame, ignition and flame propagation times were reduced again.

#### (3) Centrally Mounted Catalytic Igniter in the Afterburner Design – With Auxiliary Vaporizer Stabilizer Fuel System

This configuration also included an auxiliary fuel system supplying the catalytic igniter and fuel manifold, as well as a 0.07-inch side nozzle in the Venturi wall.

At all altitudes up to the engine’s limit of 52,000 feet at Mach 0.9, when the vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow was at or below nominal, the afterburner experienced flame propagation issues. In practice, this problem could be eliminated by increasing the vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply and/or increasing the fuel manifold flow. The required values are listed in the "Test Results."

Additionally, increasing the vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply also reduced the ignition time of the inner-ring vaporizer stabilizer, thereby improving the fuel-filling time.

For a given vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow, studies of different fuel manifold flow rates showed that "ignition" time and flame propagation improved with increased fuel supply. However, it was impossible to supply sufficient fuel to the catalytic igniter and inner-ring stabilizer area using only the current fuel manifold. This study also indicated that increasing the vaporizer stabilizer fuel would be necessary to provide optimal ignition conditions.

Increasing the Venturi fuel supply near its known rich-fuel limit, under the proposed higher vaporizer stabilizer flow rates, increased the combustion chamber ignition time.

#### (4) Early Production Engines

Engines 41 (Afterburner 366), Afterburner AU6, and Engine 507 (Afterburner H370) are compared in Figures RHD952 and RHD1023 for automatic ignition results across three engines.

With nominal vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow, this type of engine could reliably ignite at 40,000 feet, Mach 0.9. However, when more total vaporizer stabilizer fuel was introduced (e.g., Engine 507), ignition was possible at states higher than the current maximum testable state of the engine, i.e., 52,000 feet, Mach 0.9 (P₁ = 5 psia).

On this engine (equipped with a 6-second timer), the total afterburner ignition time achieved was 4–5 seconds. This time could be further reduced with several vaporizer stabilizer fuel-filling patterns and a 3-second timer. When the vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow reached the level of Engine 507, no combustion chamber flame propagation issues remained. Further validation was conducted in Test 14. The differences between Engines 43 and 41 were likely due to their different vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow rates.

---

### Recommendations

The current ignition system, including a 3-second timer device, can be further developed to potentially achieve an afterburner ignition limit with a total pressure of 6 psia. Two improvements are needed:

(a) Increase the vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow.

(b) Increase the fuel manifold fuel flow—but maintain the existing Venturi fuel flow.

The minimum vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow required for successful ignition and flame propagation is as follows:

| Altitude (feet) | Mach Number | Total Vaporizer Stabilizer Flow (gallons/hour) | | |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|--------|
|                 |             | Current                                       | Required       | Increase % |
| 36,000          | 0.9         | 214                                           | 274            | 28      |
| 45,000          | 0.9         | 137                                           | 210            | 53.7    |
| 52,000          | 0.9         | 92                                            | 170            | 84.8    |

| Results of afterburner ignition and blowout tests conducted on Engines 41/51, and recommendations for the next phase of testing |           |

# 1.0 Introduction

The analysis of the high-altitude test cell results from Engine 41 fitted with the H366 afterburner, conducted in January 1968, has been completed. Some recommended improvements for the production version have been applied to this system. Since the last high-altitude test cell trial, this system has been improved over the early production version as follows:

(1) The needle valve of the pressure ratio regulator and the flow divider of the afterburner regulator were modified to increase engine air mass flow and fuel flow at Mach number (Mn) 2.0.

(2) The fuel supply to the vaporizer stabilizer at high altitude was increased by approximately **90%** at 50,000 feet and Mn 0.9.

(3) A total of **2.8%** of the main afterburner fuel was redirected to the inner fuel manifold, as used in the early production version.

# 2.0 Results

(1) The afterburner ignition altitude was increased by approximately **9,000 feet** compared to the early production version, reaching about **47,500 feet** at Mn 0.9. In this test, **47,500 feet** was the blowout altitude. As previously reported, the fuel-filling time of the catalytic igniter at such altitudes is a critical factor.

(2) Compared to the early production version, the afterburner blowout characteristics deteriorated by approximately **8,000 feet**. Observations indicated this was a rich blowout, clearly influenced by the fuel supply to the vaporizer stabilizer. During testing, adjustments were made to the vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply; reducing the fuel supply increased the blowout altitude, but the fuel supply could not be reduced significantly below the recommended standard.

# 3.0 Discussion

There is no doubt that increasing the fuel supply to the vaporizer stabilizer degrades afterburner blowout performance, with results worse than those obtained in the high-altitude simulation rig.

The most likely explanation is that the inner vaporizer stabilizer is over-fueled, promoting blowout. Visual observations from previous blowout tests indicated that in some cases, at an afterburner pressure of **5 psi (absolute)**, other vaporizer stabilizers experienced lean blowout while the inner vaporizer stabilizer continued burning. This suggests that the inner stabilizer load is likely near its optimum condition.

If the standard vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply is restored, the energy output of the catalytic igniter must be increased by increasing the fuel supply to the catalytic igniter fuel ring. Minor improvements in this area are possible but will not provide the desired energy level. Additionally, at conditions exceeding the predicted Mn 0.9 and altitude of **48,000 feet**, there remains the issue of fuel-filling delay in the vaporizer stabilizer. The Fuel Systems Department is currently investigating the fuel-filling delay problem.

Two scenarios are considered:

**A**
(1) Restore the predetermined fuel supply to each ring of the vaporizer stabilizer as in the early production version.
(2) Improve the catalytic ignition device to increase output energy and enhance fuel-filling in the catalytic igniter.
(3) Improve the fuel-filling delay of the vaporizer stabilizer.

**B**
(1) Maintain the increased fuel supply to the vaporizer stabilizer but cut off fuel to the inner vaporizer stabilizer.
(2) Implement improvements to the catalytic ignition device as in A(2).
(3) Eliminate the fuel-filling delay issue of the vaporizer stabilizer at high altitude.

From the perspective of afterburner ignition, increasing the fuel supply to the vaporizer stabilizer remains highly advantageous. Testing on Engine 41 demonstrated this, with all ignitions propagating instantaneously before blowout occurred. It is crucial to determine a system compatible with production improvements and conduct further high-altitude test cell trials.

## 4.0 Recommended High-Altitude Test Cell Trials

**A**
(1) Use the new pressure ratio regulator needle valve and afterburner regulator flow divider.
(2) Implement the mentioned improvements to the catalytic igniter, combined with any measures to improve vaporizer stabilizer fuel-filling delay.
(3) Conduct performance, blowout, and ignition verification.

**B**
(1) Apply the aforementioned changes to vaporizer stabilizer fuel distribution and use an auxiliary pump to supply fuel to the vaporizer stabilizer.
(2) Retain the improvements to the catalytic igniter.
(3) Adjust the vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply and verify blowout and ignition.

**Development Technical Report**

**Summary of afterburner ignition and blowout tests conducted on Engine 20003 with the H366T afterburner in the high-altitude test cell**

# 1.0 Introduction

1.1 In February 1968, Engine 20003 fitted with the H366T afterburner was tested for afterburner ignition and blowout in the high-altitude test cell. The tests were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of improvements to the catalytic igniter and vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply system.

1.2 Three afterburner combustion standards were tested:

(a) Early production version.
(b) Early production version with a catalytic igniter system supplying greater fuel flow.
(c) Early production version with improved catalytic igniter, increased vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow, and distribution.

# 2.0 Conclusions

2.1 During testing of Engine 20003 with the H366T afterburner on the early production version, the combustion chamber achieved an ignition altitude of **46,500 feet** at Mn 1.1. Additionally, using AVCAT fuel at Mn 0.52, the combustion chamber ignition altitude reached **38,500 feet**.

2.2 Improving the catalytic igniter enhanced the combustion chamber ignition boundary to **50,500 feet** at Mn 1.1 and **65,500 feet** at Mn 2.0. The latter corresponds to an afterburner pressure of **8 psi (absolute)**. At these altitudes, ignition time remained relatively long due to poor flame propagation in the vaporizer stabilizer.

2.3 Increasing the vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply by **60 gallons/hour** resulted in near-instantaneous flame propagation within the combustion chamber.

2.4 These results further confirm the necessity of the two improvement measures for enhanced afterburner ignition, as stated in Report DTR86020. These measures are: increasing the fuel supply to the catalytic igniter spray ring to boost catalytic igniter output energy, and increasing the vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply to accelerate flame propagation in the combustion chamber.

2.5 Based on these tests, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that poor flame propagation in the combustion chamber under high-altitude conditions with the early production vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply is determined by the fuel-filling characteristics of the vaporizer stabilizer.

2.6 As mentioned in Report DTR86052, modifying the vaporizer stabilizer fuel distribution can increase the vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply without degrading afterburner blowout performance.

2.7 As confirmed by testing on Engine 20003, the early production afterburner blowout at Mn 0.9 occurred at **50,000 feet**, with an afterburner pressure of **7.2 psi (absolute)**. During testing of Engine 43 in June of last year, blowout occurred at a pressure of **5 psi² (absolute)**, corresponding to Mn 0.9 and an altitude of **55,000 feet**. This performance degradation is attributed to the reintroduction of fuel into the inner fuel manifold.

2.8 The following improvements are recommended for the next high-altitude test cell trial:

(1) Modify the afterburner regulator to increase the vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply by **60 gallons/hour** across the entire operating range.

(2) Improve the vaporizer stabilizer fuel distribution at a total test cell flow number of **32**.

(3) Improve the catalytic ignition system based on current high-altitude test cell trials.

# 3.0 Improvements

3.1 Improvements to the catalytic igniter include:

(1) Increasing the fuel supply to the spray ring (catalytic igniter spray ring orifice diameter: **0.046 inches**).

(2) Replacing the simple **0.025-inch** restrictor in the Venturi fuel supply line with an attenuator.

(3) Increasing the restrictor diameter in the main fuel line to **0.04 inches**.

(4) Reducing the cracking pressure of the check valve from **200 psi** to **120 psi** to increase the fuel supply to the catalytic igniter at high altitude.

3.2 The third part of the test involved modifying the vaporizer stabilizer fuel distribution to reduce the load on the inner vaporizer stabilizer.

3.3 For auto-ignition, the vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply was increased by **40 gallons/hour**. During ignition with the auxiliary fuel supply system, the fuel supply could vary between the early production standard value and the early production standard value plus **100 gallons/hour**.

# 4.0 Testing and Results

4.1 The test sequence was as follows:

(1) Early production ignition tests using AVTUR fuel at Mn 1.1.

(2) Early production ignition and blowout tests using AVCAT fuel at Mn 0.52.

(3) Ignition and blowout tests at Mn 1.1 using AVTUR fuel and the improved catalytic ignition system.

(4) Ignition and blowout tests at Mn 2.0 under the same conditions as (3).

(5) Blowout and auxiliary fuel ignition tests at Mn 1.1 and 2.0 using AVTUR fuel, with modified vaporizer stabilizer fuel distribution and fuel supplied via an auxiliary fuel system.

(6) Final auto-ignition tests at Mn 1.1 using all improvements from item (5).

4.2 Figures **1–5** illustrate auto-ignition scenarios. Figures **6–8** show the relationship between altitude, Mach number, and ignition time. The results of blowout optimization tests with varying vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply are shown in Figure 9. Figure 10 depicts the variation of vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply with Mach number. Figure 11 illustrates the effect of auto-afterburner engagement and afterburner engagement with vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply establishment on ignition time.

# 5.0 Observations

5.1 Analysis of dynamic curves recorded by the ultraviolet recorder during auto-ignition revealed three types of pressure rise patterns in the afterburner pressure oscillogram: single-stage, two-stage, and three-stage pressure rise.

5.2 The three-stage pattern shown in Figure 1 was limited to auto-ignition in the early production version. This suggests that the vaporizer stabilizer...

### 5.0 Catalytic Igniter Performance

When the fuel supply to the vaporizer stabilizer is low, the flame propagation time is relatively long. Figure 1 also shows that after the catalytic igniter ignites, the inner ring ignites first, followed by full ignition.

#### 5.3
The improvement of the catalytic igniter has made ignition a two-stage process. However, at higher altitudes, the flame propagation time does not appear to be significantly reduced.

#### 5.4
When the fuel supply to the vaporizer stabilizer is increased, both single-stage and two-stage ignition occur. However, in the two-stage ignition mode, the flame propagation time is significantly reduced. In all cases, full ignition occurs immediately after initial ignition.

#### 5.5
At lower afterburner pressures, i.e., below 15 psi (absolute), the ignition time of the catalytic igniter increases rapidly, regardless of improvements to the igniter. The high-altitude ignition capability of the catalytic igniter is limited by the timer.

#### 5.6
Under the condition of Mach number (Mn) = 2, tests were conducted to optimize the flameout characteristics using an improved fuel distribution scheme for the vaporizer stabilizer (see Figure 9). The tests showed that, compared to the baseline flameout data at \( P_8 = 7.2 \) psi, the highest flameout altitude occurred when the vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow was increased by 60 gallons/hour over the early production type, at \( P_8 = 7.0 \) psi.

### 6.0 Discussion

#### 6.1
Figures 1 to 5 show that as the afterburner pressure decreases, the ignition time of the catalytic igniter increases significantly. This cannot be attributed solely to an increase in fuel-filling time but appears to be related to a certain relationship between the catalytic activity and afterburner pressure, or possibly a fuel preparation issue.

##### 6.1.1
Regarding the catalytic activity issue, Btn, AEP, and other laboratory personnel attempted to derive a theoretical relationship between pressure and catalytic rate from test results, but no conclusive results were obtained. Only qualitative observations could be made, indicating that flame propagation on the catalyst surface deteriorates as pressure decreases.

##### 6.1.2
To optimize fuel preparation and the fuel flow of the catalytic ignition system, a series of tests were conducted on the combustion test rig. These tests involved varying the restrictor orifice size, fuel type, and fuel manifold size.

#### 6.2
A fuel flowmeter for the vaporizer stabilizer was installed on the engine and afterburner, enabling precise flow measurements. This confirmed that at a given afterburner pressure, different Mach numbers result in different fuel flow rates to the vaporizer stabilizer. The variation is shown in Figure 10. At Mn = 2.0, the fuel flow increases significantly, which has a positive effect on ignition at this Mach number. Regarding flame propagation during afterburner ignition, the nominal fuel flow regulation of the early production-type afterburner is critical. This explains the inconsistency in previous high-altitude afterburner ignition test results, where better results were consistently obtained at Mach 2.0. Since the reserve engines operated at \( P_1 \) below 5 psi (absolute), ignition tests were previously conducted at Mach 2.0.

#### 6.3
Clearly, the flame propagation issue in the combustion chamber is related to the internal fuel-filling condition of the vaporizer stabilizer, based on two observations:

1. The final part of the tests on Engine No. 20003 and Afterburner No. H366T was conducted using an auxiliary vaporizer stabilizer fuel supply system, with results shown in Figure 11. It was noted that when the fuel flow to the vaporizer stabilizer was fully established before afterburner engagement, flame propagation was instantaneous and independent of the vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow rate.

2. Tests were conducted on a heated test rig with water injection at Hucknall. The tests showed that after boiling occurred in the restrictor of the vaporizer stabilizer, flameout occurred within a few seconds. The fuel supplied to the vaporizer stabilizer during the tests was AVTUR and AVTAG.

#### 6.4
The results of tests increasing the vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow indicate that previous tests, i.e., the predetermined fuel flow rates for each ring of the early production-type vaporizer stabilizer, were too low for high-altitude afterburner ignition (see Reports DTR86020 and DTR86052). The scheme to increase the vaporizer stabilizer fuel flow should be implemented, especially if it improves the fuel-filling of the vaporizer stabilizer. If the improvement to fully open the vaporizer stabilizer rotary valve is not planned, this scheme is necessary.

#### 6.5
During high-altitude test cell trials in January 1968 using Engine No. 41 and Afterburner No. H366, the fuel flow to the vaporizer stabilizer was doubled at high altitude while maintaining the original distribution ratio. With this predetermined fuel flow for each ring, although afterburner ignition and flame propagation were good, the combustion chamber experienced flameout at a pressure of 8.5 psi (absolute). In contrast, during the July 1967 high-altitude test cell trials using Engine No. 43 and Afterburner No. AU6, flameout occurred at 5 psi (absolute).

After the Engine No. 41 tests, it was decided to maintain the early production-type fuel flow for the inner ring vaporizer stabilizer and increase the fuel flow to the middle and outer ring vaporizer stabilizers to provide a more uniform load for each stabilizer (see Report DTR86052). The table below lists the fuel load per inch of circumference for each type of vaporizer stabilizer.

| **Configuration**                     | **Increased Fuel Flow at High Altitude** | **Inner Ring Stabilizer** | **Middle Ring Stabilizer** | **Outer Ring Stabilizer** | **Flameout Condition**                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Original Design                       |                                          | 0.169                     | 0.178                      | 0.175                     | At \( P_8 = 5.5 \) psi (absolute), the inner ring experienced lean flameout first.                          |
| Early Production Type 43/10, July 1967|                                          | 0.295                     | 0.158                      | 0.155                     | At \( P_8 = 5 \) psi (absolute), the middle and outer rings experienced lean flameout first.                |
| Early Production Type 20003/6, Feb 1968|                                          | 0.295                     | 0.158                      | 0.155                     | At \( P_8 = 7.2 \) psi (absolute), all stabilizers experienced flameout.                                   |
| Proposed Improved Type 41/15, Jan 1968| 100%                                     | 0.590                     | 0.316                      | 0.310                     | At \( P_8 = 8.5 \) psi (absolute), all stabilizers experienced rich flameout.                              |
| Improved Fuel Distribution 20003/6, Feb 1968 | 60%                              | 0.309                     | 0.244                      | 0.241                     | At \( P_8 = 7.0 \) psi (absolute), all stabilizers experienced flameout.                                   |

#### 6.6
From the above table, it can be seen that for Engine No. 20003/6 as an early production-type engine, the combustion chamber flameout pressure worsened, with flameout occurring at 7.2 psi (absolute) compared to 5 psi (absolute) in the previous year's tests on Engine No. 43. This may be due to the resupply of the inner fuel manifold. It is reasonable to consider the effect of fuel concentration at the combustion chamber center and to avoid burning the catalytic igniter stabilizer by directing the spray toward the edge of the inner ring vaporizer stabilizer. If at high altitude, the afterburner can be ignited with a higher fuel flow from the catalytic igniter fuel manifold, the load on the inner ring vaporizer stabilizer can be reduced, and the fuel flow to the inner fuel manifold can be further compensated. The effect of inner fuel manifold fuel flow on flameout will be verified in future high-altitude test cell trials.

| **Performance Technical Report** | **PTR 12257** |
|----------------------------------|---------------|
| Results and Discussion of Tests Conducted on the H346 Afterburner Installed on the Spey MK202 Simulator in an Altitude Test Facility | |

# **Issue 1, August 5, 1966**

# **1.0 Introduction and Summary**

Prior to afterburner testing, the simulator was calibrated using two auxiliary nozzles with exit diameters of **21.25 inches** and **22.75 inches**, simulating high and low operating lines, respectively. The results of this calibration are presented in **DTR12169**, which established the "trimmed" condition of the afterburner test rig.

Climb-to-blowout tests were conducted using a standard combustion chamber. The standard combustion chamber featured a modified **No. 3 fuel manifold** and was tested with and without a **fuel splash guard**. Other modifications included the number of fuel manifolds and the fuel distribution among them. This report presents the results of these afterburner tests.

# **2.0 Conclusions**

2.1 Reducing the **pitch circle diameter (PCD)** of the outer fuel injectors on the **No. 3 fuel manifold** improved fuel distribution, enabling higher afterburner ratios before encountering rough combustion.

2.2 Removing the **fuel splash guard** and relocating the **No. 4 fuel manifold** downstream to the edge of the **heat shield** reduced the afterburner ratio by approximately **2%**, equivalent to the afterburner ratio achieved with a standard fuel distribution using three fuel manifolds for a given afterburner fuel flow.

2.3 Afterburner performance could be improved by **overfueling the No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 fuel manifolds** while reducing the fuel flow to the **No. 4 fuel manifold**.

2.4 During simulator testing, it was essential to ensure the reliable operation of the **nozzle position indicator**, as thrust measurements were unreliable. This was the only method for determining the afterburner ratio.

# **3.0 Discussion**

## **3.1 Measurements**

### **3.1.1 Determination of Afterburner Ratio**

As discussed in **PTR12169**, thrust measurements during non-afterburning calibration of the test rig were insufficiently precise for determining the afterburner ratio. **Figure 1** presents afterburner ratio values derived from standard combustion chamber tests, illustrating the degree of scatter. Therefore, the only reliable method for obtaining the afterburner ratio was through estimation, using the theoretical relationship between the afterburner ratio and the change in effective area from non-afterburning to afterburning conditions, as indicated by the **nozzle position indicator** readings. In altitude test facilities, engine thrust measurements were highly reliable. Based on experience with the **Spey 37 engine**, the afterburner ratio could be determined simultaneously via thrust and nozzle position indicator, with the latter proving highly satisfactory. This validated the use of the nozzle position indicator method for determining the afterburner ratio in rig testing.

### **3.1.2 Fuel Flow Rate**

Prior to testing, all turbine flowmeters used were carefully calibrated against an **Avery-Hardoll** (a positive-displacement flowmeter brand) and found to be consistent with total flow measurements obtained simultaneously from both turbine flowmeters and the **Avery-Hardoll**. Thus, fuel flow distribution was precisely known.

These flow rates, compared with the required flow rates specified in technical documentation, are shown in **Figures 3, 5, and 6**.

### **3.1.3 Pressure Measurements**

During simulator calibration, pressure measurements were well-plotted and, as expected, proportional to **\(P_i\)**. If the **nozzle controller (microjet)** functioned correctly to restore the rig to its non-afterburning state, this relationship should have been maintained during afterburning. During standard combustion chamber testing, until duct failure, **\(S14/P_i\)** varied by **+2½%** (see **Figure 7**), while **S503** varied by **+4¼%** (i.e., **⅔** of the high operating line corresponding value). After duct repair, in low operating line calibration, the **S503-P** relationship changed by **-¼%**, as shown in **Figure 8**. This change in **S503** was likely a calibration shift caused by repositioning the **S503** probe mounting during duct repair, rather than a significant change in the afterburner combustion chamber state. Sufficient data were available to verify that the rig had been trimmed to the non-afterburning calibration state, ensuring correct inlet conditions for the afterburner combustion chamber.

# **4.0 Results**

The intention was to achieve maximum afterburning using four fuel manifolds on the standard combustion chamber, but rough combustion was encountered. It was hypothesized that reducing the **pitch circle diameter (PCD)** of the outer fuel injector orifices on the **No. 3 fuel manifold** would improve lateral fuel distribution. Comparison with rough combustion boundaries confirmed an improvement in smooth combustion boundaries, as shown in **Figures 4, 5, and 6**. Removing the **fuel splash guard** slightly reduced the afterburner ratio (by approximately **2%**) but improved altitude stability, allowing the afterburner to operate stably at a total pressure **2 psi** lower, achieving the afterburner total pressure design value of **5 psi** when compared with standard fuel distribution using three fuel manifolds. All subsequent tests were conducted without the **fuel splash guard**. It should be noted that after removing the **fuel splash guard**, the outer fuel manifold was moved downstream to the plane of the **heat shield** edge to prevent fuel from impinging behind the splash guard.

Overfueling the **No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 fuel manifolds** by approximately **15%** increased the afterburner ratio by about **5%**. Further overfueling tests with three fuel manifolds were not conducted. However, when using four fuel manifolds, with the **No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 fuel manifolds** overfueled by the same amount (**≈15%**) and the **No. 4 fuel manifold** flow reduced to maintain the same total flow, the afterburner ratio increased by approximately **7%** relative to the standard distribution. No optimization tests for fuel distribution were performed.

# **5.0 Figures**

**Figures 1 to 8** present the results of various tests conducted on the **H346 afterburner** mated with the **MK202 simulator** in an altitude test facility.

**Appendix Tables A, B, C, D, E, and F** summarize the test results but are omitted here due to illegibility (Publisher’s Note).

### **Performance Technical Report**
**PTR 12169**
**Results and Discussion of Non-Afterburning High and Low Operating Line Calibration Tests Conducted on the Spey MK202 Simulator in the Altitude Test Facility**

**First Edition**
**30 December 1965**

---

### **1.0 Introduction**

It is intended to install an afterburner behind the engine simulator in the altitude test facility to conduct ignition, performance, and flameout tests on the Spey MK202 afterburner using a test method similar to that of the RB153-61.

In previous models, thrust measurement accuracy was highly problematic during tests on the test rig. Therefore, prior to testing the MK202 afterburning system, the test rig was thoroughly calibrated using a non-ignited afterburner.

Two auxiliary nozzles were used to simulate the MK202’s low and high operating lines, with nozzle diameters of **22.75 inches** and **21.25 inches**, respectively. This report presents and discusses the calibration results.

---

### **2.0 Conclusions**

2.1 Thrust determination remains imprecise.

2.2 The measurements used to determine drag terms are satisfactory, but it appears that some "drag" terms may not have been accounted for.

2.3 The errors in the load cell readings remain unexplained.

---

### **3.0 Summary**

Two calibrations were performed: one using a **22.75-inch-diameter** nozzle to simulate the **low low-pressure operating line**, and another using a **21.25-inch-diameter** nozzle to simulate the **high low-pressure operating line**.

The calibration results are shown in **Figures 1 to 12** and **Tables A and B**. These test results, when compared with theoretical predictions, suggest that the drag term measurements are satisfactory but indicate that one or more drag terms may have been overlooked. Errors in the load cell readings, first observed in previous altitude test facility simulator tests, remain unexplained. Despite meticulous care in recording load cell readings, these anomalies persist, making it difficult to accurately derive performance and afterburning ratios.

### **5.0 Discussion**

#### **5.1 Determination of Gross Thrust**

Gross thrust is determined from the net thrust measured by the load cell and corrections for "drag" terms, which include inlet momentum and pressure drops across seals. In this specific setup, these drag terms occur at the preheater inlet and the inlets of the two ducts supplying bypass air. The complete calculation formula is provided in **Section 7.4**.

#### **5.2 Drag Terms**

Theoretically, drag terms should plot as a set of straight lines passing through the origin as a function of plenum total pressure \( P_i \). The momentum term should plot as a single curve (**Figures 1 and 6**), while the pressure drop term—and thus the total drag—should vary with the ram pressure ratio \( P_i / p_0 \). This was indeed observed (**Figures 2 and 7**).

#### **5.3 Comparison of Test Results with Theory**

Section 7.0 explains that \( X_G / p_0 \) (gross thrust / \( p_0 \)), \( X_D / p_0 \) (total drag / \( p_0 \)), and \( X_L / p_0 \) (load cell reading / \( p_0 \), i.e., \( (X_G - X_D) / p_0 \)) should plot as straight lines against \( P_i / p_0 \). **Figures 4 and 9** show that the \( X_D / p_0 \) data points align well, but \( X_L / p_0 \) exhibits significant scatter, which is also reflected in the \( \Delta X_G / p_0 \) values. Due to this scatter, the test results were analyzed using average lines drawn through the scattered points. These average lines reveal discrepancies between theory and test results, attributed to overlooked terms. The scatter around the average lines indicates inaccuracies in net thrust measurement.

In **Figures 5 and 10**, the slope of the \( \Delta X_L \) vs. \( \Delta p_0 \) curve yields an effective area value at which the experimentally determined thrust/\( p_0 \) curve intersects the ordinate. Under the condition that \( X_i = X_G - X_D \), average lines were drawn through the experimental values of \( X_G / p_0 \) and \( X_L / p_0 \).

The gross thrust calculated from the afterburner inlet conditions was compared with the measured gross thrust, where the inlet conditions were determined from measurements of airflow, fuel flow, and \( T_6 \) in the test rig. The comparison shows that the calculated (or theoretical) thrust is higher than the average line obtained from the measured \( (X_L + X_D) / p_0 \) values. The difference is \( 18 \cdot (P_i / p_0) - 42.8 \) for the low operating line and \( 13.5 \cdot (P_i / p_0) - 42.8 \) for the high operating line. These differences may represent unaccounted drag terms.

The determination of afterburner conditions indicates that the calculated afterburner total pressure ratio is approximately **2% lower** than the average value measured by the total pressure rake upstream of the nozzle. This discrepancy may be due to the influence of total pressure distribution within the duct, making the measured value not a true average. However, it confirms that the calculated \( P_8 \) is at least reasonable.

**\( P_8 / p_i \) Values**

|                | Low Operating Line | High Operating Line |
|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|
|                | Calculated | Measured | Calculated/Measured |
| \( P_8 / p_i \) | 0.466      | 0.474    | 0.985               |
|                | 0.480      | 0.490    | 0.980               |

#### **5.4 Load Cell Readings**

As noted in **Section 5.3**, deviations in the load cell readings \( X_L \) cause scatter in \( X_G \). These deviations were observed during low operating line calibration and recurred during high operating line calibration. To investigate this issue, some checks were performed using data points from the high operating line with \( I_8^2 \), \( P_i \), and \( X_L \). The \( X_L \) readings for some check points differed from those of corresponding previous run points. However, it is noteworthy that when a series of points were run at constant \( P_i \) and varying \( p_0 \), the load cell readings formed a smooth curve, whereas readings taken earlier at the same \( P_i \) could not be connected smoothly (**Figures 11 and 9**). Nevertheless, the \( \Delta X_L / \Delta p_0 \) values for points on this curve varied around an average of **110**, whereas the theoretical value is **67.2**, representing the difference between the inlet and outlet flow areas of the rig.

It should be emphasized that during these calibrations, load cell readings were taken with extreme care to ensure accurate measurements. Despite multiple checks and verifications before recording, these anomalies persisted.

#### **5.5 Afterburner Nozzle Controller (Microjet) Adjustment**

The pressure connected to the nozzle controller is the plenum total pressure and the static pressure in the bypass flow of the mixer. The static pressures measured at **S2**, **S10**, and **S14** in the mixer’s bypass flow were highly consistent, as shown in **Tables A and B**. **S10** is connected to the nozzle controller, and its pressure is read at **S14**.

The nozzle controller is adjusted based on \( P_i / S14 \). When reverting to the low operating line, the ratio \( P_i / S14 \) should be **2.15**, derived from a set of readings. Upon further analysis, the average value was found to be **2.155**, confirming that the initial value of **2.15** is satisfactory.

To revert the engine to the high operating line, the ratio \( P_i / S14 \) should be adjusted to **2.135**.

### **7.0 Theoretical Formulas**

#### **7.1 Nozzle Exit Geometric Area**
- **High operating line:** 356 in²
- **Low operating line:** 406 in²
A flow coefficient of **1** is assumed, which is fully appropriate for expansion ratios > **2.0**.

#### **7.2 Test Rig Inlet Areas**
- Preheater flow area \( A_{pd} = 186.2 \) in²
- Preheater seal area \( A_{p5} = 12 \) in²
- Left bypass flow area \( A_{B1} = 108.4 = A_{B2} \)
- Left bypass seal area \( A_{B1s} = 4.1 = A_{B2s} \)

#### **7.3 Nozzle Choking Conditions**
Under choked nozzle conditions, all pressure relationships, except \( p_0 \), should be fixed and dependent only on geometric areas.

#### **7.4 Inlet Drag \( X_D \)**

\[
X_D = \frac{\sum MV}{g} + \sum A_s (p_s - p_0) + \sum A_d (p_d - p_0)
\]

i.e.,

\[
X_D = \frac{M_p V_p}{g} + \frac{M_{B1} V_{B1}}{g} + \frac{M_{B2} V_{B2}}{g} + A_{ps} (P_{ps} - p_0) + A_{pd} (p_{pd} - p_0) + A_{B1s} (P_{B1} - p_0) + A_{B1} (P_{B1} - p_0) + A_{B2s} (P_{B2} - p_0) + A_{B2} (P_{B2} - p_0)
\]

From **Section 7.3**:

\[
X_D = K P_i - \sum A p_0
\]

From **Section 7.2**:

\[
\sum A = 186.2 + 12 + 2 (108.4 + 4.1) = 423.2
\]

From **Figures 4 and 9**:
- \( K = 365 \) for the low operating line
- \( K = 345.5 \) for the high operating line

#### **7.5 Gross Thrust \( X_G \)**

\[
X_G = f(Y) P_8 A_{FN} - A_{FN} p_0
\]

where \( f(Y) = 1.26 \) for the temperatures used.

- \( P_8 / P_i^* = 0.466 \) for the low operating line (see **Section 5.3**)
- \( P_8 / P_i^* = 0.48 \) for the high operating line (see **Section 5.3**)

Thus:
- \( X_G = 240 P_i - 406 p_0 \) for the low operating line
- \( X_G = 216 P_i - 356 p_0 \) for the high operating line

# 3.0 Introduction

A series of tests were conducted on the Spey 20003/7 engine to determine the final afterburning system for the current production model engines.

Most of the testing was performed with the current afterburner configuration, which includes no fuel supply to the No. 1 fuel manifold and a drilled heat shield. However, some verification tests were also conducted on the earlier model (i.e., all fuel manifolds supplying fuel, no holes in the heat shield, but with increased fuel supply to the vaporizer stabilizer and a lower low-pressure operating line, similar to the current model).

In all tests, no ejector air was introduced into the ejector nozzle, but the results were corrected for the ejector airflow specified for each flight condition.

## 4.0 Engine and Afterburner Standard Configuration Schemes

### 4.1 Spey 20003 Engine Configuration 7

The standard production engine configuration features a single inflection point \(X_2\) needle valve in the pressure ratio regulator, providing a lower low-pressure operating line at Mach number \(M_N = 2\), resulting in a higher airflow rate. This is a technical characteristic of the current production model.

### 4.2 Afterburner H366T

Initially, similar to the earlier model, all four fuel manifolds supplied fuel. During later performance testing of the current model, the No. 1 fuel manifold was set to no fuel supply, and a drilled heat shield was installed.

The main afterburner fuel flow distribution ratios (obtained from test bed tests) for the two afterburners are as follows:

|                | Early Model | Current Model |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| No. 1 Manifold | 2.7%        | 0             |
| No. 2 Manifold | 21.5%       | 22.0%         |
| No. 3 Manifold | 53.6%       | 55.0%         |
| No. 4 Manifold | 22.2%       | 23.0%         |

The fuel supply to the vaporizer stabilizer is as follows:

- Inner ring: 17.4%
- Middle ring: 31.0%
- Outer ring: 51.6%

The nozzle is equipped with a saddle stop device to limit the maximum usable area, with nominal sizes of 700, 800, and 900 square inches.

The nozzle position indicator system includes a 7000-ohm resistor to improve indication accuracy.

### 4.3 Afterburner Fuel Supply Control

The adjustment of the afterburner regulator essentially meets the fuel supply requirements of the earlier model and can accommodate the additional fuel supply needed to achieve the performance of the current model. Additionally, sufficient fuel supply is required to verify the "buzz" boundary. For this purpose, a small valve (Kidder) is installed to allow controlled leakage of fuel from upstream to downstream of the main metering valve, but this only changes the fuel supply to the main fuel manifolds.

During testing, to further increase the fuel supply, the air diverter of the afterburner regulator was replaced and fine-tuned, allowing simultaneous adjustment of the fuel supply to both the main fuel manifolds and the vaporizer stabilizer.

The fuel supply to the vaporizer stabilizer in the current model is 60 gallons/hour more than in the earlier model. The nominal fuel distribution for the vaporizer stabilizer is:

- Outer ring: 56%
- Middle ring: 31%
- Inner ring: 14% (Total flow number \(F_N = 32.0\))

The nominal fuel distribution for the main fuel manifolds is:

- No. 1 Manifold: No fuel supply
- No. 2 Manifold: 22.5%
- No. 3 Manifold: 55.6%
- No. 4 Manifold: 22.9%

## 5.0 Testing of the "Blue" Standard Engine

Initial verification was conducted at \(M_N = 2\), essentially using the earlier model combustion chamber. The primary differences from the earlier production model were an increased fuel supply to the vaporizer stabilizer (+60 gallons/hour) and the use of the current production model's pressure ratio regulator needle valve to achieve a lower low-pressure operating line at \(M_N = 2\). Performance was verified up to the nominal maximum fuel supply and the "buzz" limit.

## 6.0 Verification of the Current Production Model System

Following the verification of the earlier model, all further tests were conducted with no fuel supply to the No. 1 fuel manifold and with the heat shield modified to a drilled type.

A small valve was used to increase the afterburner fuel supply, and further increases were achieved by fine-tuning the diverter of the afterburner fuel regulator.

# 8.0 Performance Verification Overview

## 8.1 Sea Level Condition

During tests simulating sea level conditions, several afterburner operating points were obtained. The initial curves were acquired at R01 values of 1.0 and 2.0, while later curves were obtained only at **R01 = 1.0**. Figure 16 compares these curves with the engine performance obtained on the test stand prior to high-altitude test cell trials. The peak of all curves is limited by a 710 in² saddle stop, which is also the reason why the thrust obtained is lower than the results from the test stand.

Tests on two current engines at different R01 values showed a thrust difference of 250 lbf, which can be attributed to pressure differences acting on the engine surface—see Section 8.8. This raises the curves for records **9–12** to the same level as records **14–16**. At this point, the high-altitude test cell performance is still approximately 300 lbf lower than the test stand results.

Comparing the afterburner performance curves at the same R01 value shows that during testing, performance improved for a given **F<sub>R</sub> / M<sub>1</sub>**.

## 8.2 M<sub>N</sub> = 0.9, 36,089 ft

Fewer tests were conducted at **M<sub>N</sub> = 0.9**. These included one "buzz" condition point obtained with No. 1 fuel manifold not supplying fuel and equipped with a standard heat shield, as well as two test points with a drilled heat shield. The limiting condition for this state was the maximum available fuel supply (see Figure 1).

## 8.3 M<sub>N</sub> = 1.1, 36,089 ft

Initial verification at **M<sub>N</sub> = 1.1** indicated a state limited by "buzz." Further verification showed that engine performance continued to deteriorate when operating in the "buzz" condition.

Corresponding test points obtained from engines **20003/6** and **20006/6** during high-altitude test cell trials showed higher thrust at a given **F<sub>R</sub> / M<sub>1</sub>**. However, these tests used an early-type afterburner, i.e., with No. 1 fuel manifold supplying fuel. Additionally, engine **20006** had a higher low-pressure operating line (**+0.06** pressure ratio), resulting in approximately **2.5%** higher net thrust.

## 8.4 M<sub>N</sub> = 1.53, Varying P<sub>1</sub>

At **M<sub>N</sub> = 1.53** and **36,089 ft**, **P<sub>1</sub>** was varied. All tests were conducted with No. 1 fuel manifold not supplying fuel and with a drilled heat shield installed. The afterburner system experienced "buzz" at **P<sub>1</sub> = 5** and **7**, but no "buzz" occurred at **P<sub>1</sub> = 12.0** with maximum fuel supply.

## 8.5 M<sub>N</sub> = 2.0, Varying P<sub>1</sub>

Here, **P<sub>1</sub>** varied from **7 to 22.88 psia**, with all **P<sub>1</sub>** values except **22.88 psia** reaching the "buzz" point.

Table 3 summarizes the conditions at **36,089 ft**:

Table 3

| M No. | P<sub>1</sub> psia | T<sub>1</sub> °K | XN (Ejector) Reference | Result Achieved | Remarks |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------|-----------------|---------|
| 0.9   | 5.43              | 251.5          | 7750                   | -0.65%          | Fuel supply limit |
| 1.1   | 6.83              | 269.7          | 9290*                  | +0.2% to -5.1%  | "Buzz" limit |
| 1.53  | 12.0              | 317.8          | 13260                  | +0.98%          | Maximum afterburner fuel limit |
| 2.0   | 22.88             | 389.8          | 15960*                 | +0.94%          | Maximum afterburner fuel limit |

*Results at **M<sub>N</sub> = 1.53** and **2.0** were obtained after readjusting the afterburner fuel regulator splitter.

Figure 9 also compares the final test points of engine **20003** with those obtained from an early-type combustion chamber (i.e., all fuel manifolds supplying fuel). Individual tests on the early-type combustion chamber used both early-type and current-type pressure ratio regulator needle valves. When corrected for flow differences (from Figure 9a), these results indicate that the early-type and current-type combustion chambers operate with the same efficiency.

## 8.6 Pressure Ratio Regulator Performance

Figures 12 and 13 show the operating lines of the pressure ratio regulator at test conditions with Mach numbers ranging from **0.9 to 2.0**, i.e., **P<sub>3</sub> / P<sub>6</sub>** vs. **P<sub>3</sub> / P<sub>2</sub>**, **P<sub>3</sub> / P<sub>6</sub>** vs. **M√T<sub>1</sub> / P<sub>1</sub>**, and **P<sub>2</sub> / P<sub>1</sub>** vs. **M√T<sub>1</sub> / P<sub>1</sub>**. Figure 12 clearly shows the single inflection point characteristic of the needle valve and the corresponding **M√T<sub>1</sub> / P<sub>1</sub>** value at the inflection point. Figure 13 illustrates the effect of the current-type needle valve on the low-pressure operating line.

## 8.7 Nozzle Calibration

For the first time in a high-altitude test cell, the true nozzle area was determined by installing stops on the engine nozzle assembly.

During testing, three area stops—**700, 800, and 900 in²**—were used, and comparison curves were plotted between nozzle area and nozzle position indicator readings under cold static calibration and hot operating conditions.

Near maximum conditions, the true nozzle area was approximately **40 in²** smaller than the nozzle position indicator reading.

Figure 14 also shows the relationship between **C<sub>d</sub>** and nozzle pressure ratio, from which the effective area can be derived.

## 8.8 Engine Surface Pressure

When calculating total thrust, the pressure acting on the engine surface was considered. For example, at sea level conditions with a ram pressure ratio nearly equal to 1, as mentioned in Section 8.1, thrust increased by **200–300 lbf**. This increment is sufficient to align the two simulated sea level afterburner operations (**R01 = 1.0** and **2.0**) with records **9–16**. A more detailed technical document considering surface pressure measurements is being prepared.

All thrust values quoted in this report do not account for pressure acting along the engine’s outer surface. Therefore, they are comparable to thrust values from other engines in the past.

# 1.0 Abstract

Due to poor ignition performance of the early production afterburner system on the RB168-25R engine, a series of catalytic ignition system rig tests were conducted to investigate the key factors affecting system performance and to improve the catalytic system. These tests were performed by installing a complete ignition system in an 8-inch diameter duct.

This report summarizes the test results and presents an improved system capable of achieving the fastest and most reliable ignition.

The rig test work discussed in this report includes tests conducted at three afterburner pressures (15, 10, and 6 psi) corresponding to flight Mach numbers of 0.9 at altitudes of 36,500 ft, 44,500 ft, and 53,000 ft for several catalytic igniter configurations. Tests were performed using both AVTAG and AVTUR fuels.

# 2.0 Conclusions

2.1 The recommended catalytic ignition system configuration for optimal performance consists of the following components:

1) Venturi flow restrictor (0.025 in. with filter)
2) Check valve, opening pressure 120 psi
3) Production-type fuel distribution ring with conical spray (16 × 0.046 in. orifices)
4) Afterburner strut flow restrictor with 0.043 in. internal diameter

This configuration achieves stable ignition within 2 seconds using AVTUR fuel and within 3 seconds using AVTAG fuel at 10 psi (absolute) pressure (44,500 ft altitude, 0.9 Mₙ).

2.2 For each configuration, AVTAG performance was inferior to AVTUR. Ultraviolet recorder oscillograms showed this was due to boiling of the more volatile AVTAG fuel in the Venturi tube.

2.3 When using a 120 psi check valve, the afterburner strut flow restrictor size was less critical than with the early production 200 psi check valve.

2.4 The 120 psi check valve was superior to the 200 psi check valve. Under certain engine conditions, the 120 psi check valve increased S635 by 80 psi, improving ignition time with the optimal afterburner strut flow restrictor size.

2.5 Testing with both fuels showed that the early production fuel distribution ring improved performance over the original production type.

2.6 For any specific catalytic igniter arrangement, the optimal afterburner strut flow restrictor size depends on afterburner pressure. For the defined configuration, optimal sizes were 0.051 in., 0.047 in., and 0.041 in. at pressures of 15 psi, 10 psi, and 6 psi (absolute), respectively.

2.7 The effect of inlet temperature variation was studied, concluding that within the S635 range encountered in aircraft, improved inlet temperature had minimal impact on ignition time. The temperature variation range was from 720 K to 930 K.

# 3.0 Test Equipment

From March 15, 1968, to April 24, 1968, atmospheric pressure tests were conducted on Combustion Rig No. 7, Stand "A."

From May 8, 1968, to May 31, 1968, tests at pressures of 10 psi and 6 psi were conducted at Lucas Aerospace's Burnley altitude test facility.

# 4.0 Introduction

The centrally mounted catalytic igniter installed on early production engines consisted of a 200 psi check valve, a 0.036 in. afterburner strut flow restrictor, and a 0.025 in. Venturi flow restrictor. This system reliably ignited using AVTUR fuel at Mₙ = 0.9 and 40,000 ft altitude, and using AVTAG fuel at 32,000 ft altitude. To improve what was considered the major portion of ignition time—the fuel filling time—the catalytic fuel distribution ring orifice size was increased from 0.039 in. to 0.046 in., and a 120 psi check valve was installed. For given pump pressure and altitude conditions, this check valve provided an additional 80 psi fuel pressure at the catalytic igniter inlet. The 0.025 in. Venturi flow restrictor was replaced with a 7 × 0.035 in. damper having the same flow number in cold tests to prevent blockage from gum deposits caused by fuel boiling. For a given pump pressure, increasing the afterburner strut flow restrictor to 0.040 in. increased flow and reduced fuel filling time.

However, tests conducted on the altitude rig with this production-type configuration showed deteriorated ignition performance.

# 5.0 Test Objectives

The objective of this series of tests was to investigate the ignition capability of both early production and production-type catalytic systems. Further tests were conducted to study the influence of key system factors and thereby improve ignition performance.

From these results, an improved catalytic ignition system was developed to enhance ignition performance for both AVTUR and AVTAG fuels.

# 6.0 Test Rig

As shown in Figure 1, the catalytic igniter was installed in an 8-inch diameter duct. Air was supplied through a preheater to achieve airflow Mach numbers representative of those at the catalytic igniter leading edge on the engine. Most tests were conducted at 850 K, approximately 80 K lower than the temperature required at the center of the afterburner on the engine to prevent overheating of the test rig. However, some tests were conducted at 930 K to observe the effect of temperature on ignition.

Sensors recorded transient pressure rise at various points in the catalytic igniter fuel system, and a volumetric flowmeter recorded fuel flow. An event marker connected to the fuel solenoid valve circuit provided a mark on the ultraviolet recorder oscillogram when the solenoid valve was energized. Successful ignition was recorded by pressure changes in the 8-inch duct, sensed by a pressure transducer designated S503. A typical oscillogram is shown in Figure 2.

A camera was installed to observe ignition through the test rig's exhaust silencer, facing the catalytic igniter cone. Energizing the solenoid valve produced a light spot marking the ignition event on the photosensitive paper.

The test rig's fuel system is shown in Figure 1. An ejector formed the overflow system on the afterburner, used to clear fuel from the catalytic system supply lines after the catalytic system was shut down to prevent gumming and resultant flow restrictor blockage. An exhaust pipe reduced the pressure in the catalytic system to approximately 50 psi before activation, matching the back pressure required in the main fuel supply line on the engine. All piping and components downstream of the check valve were identical to those on the engine.

# 7.0 Test Procedure

The duct mass flow, temperature, and pressure were adjusted, and the fuel system upstream of the check valve was filled. The exhaust pipe solenoid valve was operated to reduce the oil pipe pressure to approximately 50 psi. The constant pressure pump pressure was then adjusted to 1000 psi, and ignition was initiated.

### **9.0 Discussion**

Due to the extensive work conducted, presenting all results would make this report excessively long. Therefore, only relevant graphs are included, covering:

a) **Effect of Afterburner Pressure** – See Section 9.1
b) **Effect of Afterburner Temperature** – See Section 9.2
c) **Effect of Fuel** – See Section 9.3
d) **Effect of Fuel Manifold** – See Section 9.4
e) **Catalytic Igniter Stability Boundary** – See Section 9.5
f) **Effect of Check Valve** – See Section 9.6
g) **Effect of 0.025-inch Restrictor + Filter** – See Section 9.7

#### **9.1 Effect of Afterburner Pressure**

**Figure 5** shows the variation of ignition time with afterburner strut restrictor size at three different canister pressures, with **S635 pressure** held constant.

It can be observed that smaller restrictors reduce ignition time at all canister pressures by increasing fuel pressure (**S635**). However, larger restrictors exhibit crossing curves, where higher fuel pressure leads to longer ignition times, likely due to over-rich conditions at the cone.

For this particular structural configuration, as canister pressure decreases from **15 psi** to **10 psi** to **6 psi (absolute)**, the optimal restrictor size decreases from **0.051 in** to **0.047 in** to **0.041 in**.

At an afterburner pressure of **15 psi (absolute)**, the engine’s specified **S635** is approximately **170 psi (absolute)**; at **10 psi (absolute)**, it is approximately **130 psi (absolute)**. When the canister pressure is **6 psi (absolute)** with a **120 psi (absolute)** check valve installed, **S635** is approximately **110 psi (absolute)**. For a **0.040 in restrictor** configuration using **AVTUR fuel**, ignition times are:

| **P₀ (psia)** | **Ignition Time (s)** |
|---------------|----------------------|
| 15 | 1.10 |
| 10 | 2.65 |
| 6 | 3.10 |

It can also be noted that as canister pressure decreases, the curves become steeper due to reduced stability limits, making **R1** selection more critical. This is confirmed by the catalytic igniter stability curves in **Figure 9**.

The same effect was observed for **AVTAG fuel**.

#### **9.2 Effect of Afterburner Temperature**

**Figure 6** shows the effect of temperature on ignition time when using **AVTUR fuel**. At lower fuel pressures, higher temperatures increase ignition time, likely due to fuel vaporization. At higher pressures, this effect diminishes as fuel flow stabilizes.

At the specified **S635 pressure of 170 psi**, for a canister pressure of **10 psi (absolute)**, the effect of temperature is minimal. Temperature variation does not affect the optimal afterburner strut restrictor size.

Tests were also conducted at a lower temperature of **720°K**. While results were limited, reducing temperature increased ignition time. The effect of lowering temperature to **720°K** appears more significant than increasing it to **930°K**.

#### **9.3 Effect of Fuel**

**Figure 7** illustrates the effect of fuel on ignition. For this specific configuration, using **AVTAG fuel** increases ignition time by approximately **1 second** compared to **AVTUR**. Across all test configurations, **AVTAG** results in longer ignition times. However, the difference in ignition time between **AVTUR** and **AVTAG** varies among configurations, indicating that both fuels should be tested for proper evaluation.

The increase in ignition time is likely due to fuel boiling and vaporization, with **AVTAG** being more volatile. This can reduce flow in the catalytic igniter and cause vapor lock in the cone fuel manifold, leading to Venturi blockage.

#### **9.4 Effect of Fuel Manifold**

**Figure 8** compares the effects of early-production and production-type fuel manifolds on ignition time for one configuration. With the optimal **R1 restrictor**, the production-type manifold reduces ignition time by approximately **0.5 seconds** compared to the early-production type. **AVTAG fuel** tests showed a similar trend, with ignition time reduced by approximately **0.75 seconds**. This improvement is likely due to better matching of fuel distribution between the Venturi and manifold. Further testing confirmed that increasing manifold orifice size to reduce Venturi fuel proportion was effective.

#### **9.5 Catalytic Igniter Ignition Curves**

**Figure 9** shows the catalytic igniter ignition curves for an early-production fuel manifold using **AVTUR fuel**. These curves are independent of fuel type, manifold, afterburner strut restrictor, and Venturi restrictor size. However, **AVTAG fuel** slightly lowers the rich limit. Near the rich limit, ignition time increases, similar to the effect of reducing canister pressure. The graph also includes fuel flow variation curves for specific afterburner strut restrictors. It can be seen that higher ignition altitudes (lower **P**) require smaller restrictor sizes. **Figure 5** further illustrates this. However, reducing restrictor size for high-altitude ignition increases ignition time at higher afterburner pressures, as the specified fuel flow shifts toward the lean limit of the catalytic igniter. Thus, the optimal restrictor size for high-altitude ignition is smaller than that for sea-level ignition. For a **7 psi (absolute)** ignition limit, regardless of Venturi restrictor size, the required afterburner strut restrictor size is approximately **0.043 in**.

#### **9.6 Effect of Check Valve**

**Figure 10** compares **120 psi** and **200 psi** check valves. The **120 psi** valve produces a flatter set of curves, though ignition time is only slightly improved. This makes the valve less sensitive to afterburner strut restrictor size and afterburner pressure. The pressures quoted are downstream of the check valve (**S635**). For a true comparison at a given engine condition (fixed upstream pressure), approximately **80 psi** should be subtracted from the **120 psi** valve line. Thus, a **125 psi S635** line for the **200 psi** valve should be compared to a **200 psi S635** line for the **120 psi** valve. It can be seen that the **120 psi** valve is superior in two aspects:

a) It produces flatter ignition curves.
b) For a given engine condition, it provides an approximate **80 psi** increase in fuel pressure.

#### **9.7 Effect of 0.025-inch + Filter Venturi Restrictor (AVTUR Fuel)**

A helical filter was added to the Venturi restrictor to prevent blockage of the **0.025-inch** orifice by gum deposits from fuel boiling in the afterburner strut fuel supply line.

**Figure 11** compares ignition test results using a **0.025-inch + filter Venturi restrictor** with a similar configuration using a simple **0.025-inch restrictor** with **AVTUR fuel**. At a specified **S635 pressure of 170 psi** with a **0.048 in afterburner strut restrictor**, ignition time was **1.4 seconds** at **10 psi (absolute)**, well within the **3-second timer limit**. At lower **S635 pressure (6 psi absolute)**, ignition was successful but approached **4 seconds**, the best configuration in this test series.

#### **9.8 Effect of 0.025-inch + Filter Venturi Restrictor (AVTAG Fuel)**

**Figure 12** shows test results for the same configuration using **AVTAG fuel**. Ignition times were longer than those with **AVTUR fuel** (Figure 7). However, at a specified **S635 pressure of 130 psi** with a **0.048 in afterburner strut restrictor**, ignition within **2.6 seconds** was possible at **10 psi (absolute)**, also within the **3-second timer limit**.

At **6 psi (absolute) canister pressure**, ignition was possible, but with this restrictor size, ignition time was very long, risking failure on the engine.

#### **9.9 Summary**

The best test configuration consisted of a **0.025-inch + filter Venturi restrictor** with an early-production fuel manifold. Unfortunately, due to insufficient test time, this Venturi restrictor was not tested with the production-type manifold, though Section 9.4 suggests such a change would improve ignition time. For this reason, the early-production manifold is included in the recommended configuration, which consists of:

1. **Venturi restrictor (0.025-inch + filter)**
2. **120 psi check valve**
3. **Catalytic igniter cone fuel manifold (16 × 0.046 in orifices)**
4. **Afterburner strut restrictor = 0.043 in**

The Venturi restrictor installed on the actual early-production configuration (i.e., **7 × 0.035 in dampers**) exhibited poor ignition performance, igniting only with large afterburner strut restrictors and high **S635 fuel pressure**. This is likely due to fuel boiling in the damper passages, restricting Venturi nozzle flow. For this reason, no results are plotted.

### **Notes on Graphs and Data**
- **Figures 5–12** (not shown here) contain plots of ignition time vs. various parameters (pressure, temperature, restrictor size, fuel type).
- **Key trends**:
  - Smaller restrictors reduce ignition time at high pressures but may cause over-rich conditions.
  - Lower canister pressures increase ignition time and steepen curves.
  - **AVTAG fuel** generally results in longer ignition times than **AVTUR**.
  - The **120 psi check valve** provides flatter ignition curves and better pressure margins.

# Review of Spey MK202 Afterburner Design Methodology

First Edition, September 29, 1976

## 1.0 Abstract

This report describes the design methodology of the Spey MK202 engine afterburning system. It outlines the design procedures, estimates system performance, and investigates the relationship between stability and combustion efficiency.

The appendices provide examples of Spey MK202 design calculations and performance estimations to illustrate the methods used by Rolls-Royce.

## 2.0 Introduction

The Spey engine is the first British turbofan engine equipped with a full afterburning system. Naturally, its design principles are largely derived from previous turbojet engines, such as Rolls-Royce’s Avon engine, as well as from scaled test rig experiments. Consequently, the design principles derived are limited by experience but can be used for preliminary design and performance estimation.

## 3.0 Afterburner Design Procedure

Figure 1 presents a flowchart of the design procedure used for a full afterburning system like the Spey MK202. The symbols used in the figure are listed in Table I.

The fundamental approach is to determine, for given afterburner inlet parameters—mass flow, pressure, and temperature—along with a specified minimum afterburner operating pressure and constrained combustion chamber length and diameter, the required thrust \(X_G\) at the guarantee point, typically at sea-level static conditions. For a defined combustion chamber geometry, the achievable afterburning thrust (or afterburning temperature \(T_R\)) is determined iteratively based on the amount of air available for combustion, combustion efficiency, and the fuel-air ratio used. The following parameters are assumed to be known for the design of the afterburner liner and combustion chamber:

a) Total pressures of the bypass and turbine exit flows (\(P_2\) and \(P_6\)).
b) Total temperatures of the bypass and turbine exit flows (\(T_2\) and \(T_8\)).
c) Mass flow rates of the bypass and turbine exit flows (\(M_2\) and \(M_6\)).
d) Total length of the afterburning system (\(L_0\)).
e) Minimum operating pressure of the afterburner (\(P_{8min}\)).
f) Required afterburning thrust at the guarantee point (\(X_G\)).

Additionally, it is evident that the specific fuel consumption (SFC) during afterburning should be as low as possible (even if not a strict requirement), and the afterburner should be as lightweight as possible. The design procedure is divided into several stages, with each component designed accordingly.

### 3.1 Determination of Mixer Geometry

The Spey MK202 employs a high-combustion-efficiency "mixed" afterburning system. This is achieved by imparting radial velocity to the bypass flow into the core flow with minimal pressure loss.

Due to limited experience with two-stream mixed afterburning, the actual design method is not yet mature. However, for engine matching requirements, it is critical that the areas of the bypass and turbine exit flows at the mixer plane are designed such that the static pressures of the two streams are equal. Given the total mixer area determined by the engine exit geometry and the number of mixing funnels, the jet angle θ can be derived. Figure 2 illustrates the general arrangement of the mixer jet configuration. The specified performance relationships have been validated through test rig experiments within the following ranges:

Thus, the mixer design must not exceed the above limits and must comply with the primary requirement of equal static pressures for the bypass and turbine exit flows at their mixing point.

### 3.2 Mixer Performance

The pressure loss of the jet mixer, commonly referred to as the mixing funnel loss, is shown by test rig results to be a function of the jet angle θ and the total pressure ratio \(P_6 / P_2\). Figure 3 shows the variation of the discharge coefficient \(C_D\) (baseline value of 0.6) with θ and the pressure ratio \(P_8 / P_2\). The mixing funnel loss for the two streams is a function of the mixing diameter and the mixing funnel perimeter and is expressed in terms of the dynamic head at the mixer plane in Figure 4. The total pressure of each stream is then determined.

The mixed flow pressure \(p_8\) can be estimated using the momentum equation:

\[
\frac{M_2 V_2}{g} + A_2 p_2 + \frac{M_6 V_6}{g} + A_6 p_6 = \frac{M_8 V_8}{g} + A_8 p_8
\]

The average temperature \(T_8\) is estimated from the sum of the thermal content of the two streams:

\[
M_2 C_{p2} T_2 + M_6 C_{p6} T_6 = M_8 C_{p8} T_8
\]

Since the system is considered "mixed," these average or "bulk" parameters are used for the combustion chamber design.

If the two streams are mixed, thrust gains can be achieved. Generally, the length from the mixer to the nozzle in the afterburning system is insufficient to ensure complete mixing. Therefore, a mixing efficiency relationship is used to determine the magnitude of partial mixing thrust. Figure 5 shows the variation of mixing efficiency \(\eta_{MIX}\) with a combined parameter representing mixer geometry and mixing length, where:

\[
\eta_{MIX} = \frac{X_{PM} - X_{UM}}{X_{FM} - X_{UM}}
\]

Where:

\(X_{PM}\) = Thrust with partial mixing (lbf)
\(X_{UM}\) = Sum of thrusts of unmixed flows (lbf)
\(X_{FM}\) = Thrust with full mixing (lbf)

### 3.3 Selection of Afterburner Diameter and Length (D, \(L_B\))

The weight of the afterburning system is proportional to the product of the square of the afterburner diameter (D) and the total length \(L_0\), i.e.,

\[
W_t \propto D^2 L_0
\]

Thus, reducing these two parameters is crucial from a weight perspective. The total length consists of the mixing length (\(L_M\)) and the combustion length (\(L_B\)), i.e.,

\[
L_0 = L_M + L_B
\]

To achieve maximum performance, the total length \(L_0\) should be as large as possible but is typically constrained by airframe geometry. For preliminary performance iteration, the minimum mixing length is taken as one times the afterburner diameter. If performance allows, the combustion length can be reduced, and the mixing length can be increased beyond this value.

The diameter directly determines the magnitude of the free-stream Mach number in the afterburner and thus the stability of afterburning combustion (i.e., larger nozzle diameters result in more stable combustion). Initially, the afterburner diameter is usually constrained by aircraft airframe geometry. If these constraints are not particularly restrictive, the total diameter of the afterburner (including the nozzle and actuators) is designed not to exceed the engine’s maximum diameter. This ensures that the afterburner does not increase the engine’s frontal area, thereby avoiding increased installation drag. After preliminary calculations of stability and efficiency, the afterburner diameter can be adjusted as needed based on performance reassessment during the design phase.

### 3.4 Determination of Flameholder Slot Width (W)

The selection of the flameholder slot width depends on the required minimum operating pressure of the afterburner, as well as the temperature and flow velocity at the afterburner inlet. This can be expressed using the stability parameter (S), with the minimum operating value derived from early test rig results being 12, where:

\[
S = \frac{p_L \cdot W}{V}
\]

Here, \(p_L\) (psia) = Static pressure at the flameholder lip.

For these calculations, the flameholder lip conditions are computed assuming a blockage ratio (β) of 30%. If the afterburner geometry deviates from this value after preliminary calculations, the stability parameter must be recalculated. Equation (6) is derived from Figure 6, which shows the stable combustion regions downstream of this type of flameholder used in the Spey MK202. It appears that \(S = 12\) provides a suitable operating range, ensuring adequate stability for the determined flameholder slot width.

### 3.5 Number of Flameholders

At this design stage, an assumption must be made regarding the amount of cooling air required for the afterburner. In preliminary calculations, a value for cooling air can be arbitrarily assumed (e.g., 10% for a full afterburning system). The magnitude of this value depends on the cooling efficiency of the heat shield design and its performance at maximum afterburning temperatures. Detailed calculations of the heat shield design and performance are provided in Reference [1]. Any corrections to the assumed amount of air available for combustion derived from heat shield design analysis require recalculation of the combustion chamber structure. Given the assumed amount of air for combustion and the assumed afterburner diameter, the inner radius of the heat shield (\(R_{HS}\)) can be calculated.

There is a clear relationship between the number of flameholders (N), slot width, and blockage ratio, as shown in Figure 7 and expressed by the following equation:

\[
\frac{R_{HS}}{W} = \frac{1}{\beta_i} \sqrt{N^2 + N - N \beta_i}
\]

Where:

\(\beta_i\) = Blockage ratio of the flameholders inside the heat shield.

Since the number of flameholders must be an integer, some adjustments to the blockage ratio may be necessary to satisfy Equation (8).

Here is the complete English translation of the Chinese technical document about the Spey MK202 aircraft engine:

Recalculation of the stabilizer slot width (W) from Equation (6) is again required due to modifications to Equation (9). Therefore, iterative calculations between W and N are necessary to simultaneously satisfy both Equation (6) and Equation (8).

## 3.6 Radial Spacing of Stabilizers

In the afterburner, the radial positioning of stabilizers is arranged according to the **Equal Groove Load (E.G.L.)** principle. This means that the radial flame extension distance from the lip of each stabilizer is equal. The stabilizer positioned radially inward is placed upstream along the flow line of the outer stabilizer, with an axial distance of twice the stabilizer slot width.

The **Equal Groove Load** is defined as:

\[
\frac{A_{R's}}{P_s} = \frac{2w}{11} z \times 4 = \frac{x}{2}
\]

Where:

\(A_{F/S}\) = Flow cross-sectional area between adjacent stabilizers
\(P_s\) = Perimeter of the stabilizer lip
\(x\) = Radial distance between adjacent stabilizers

As seen in **Figure 8**:

\[
NW + Nx_1 + x_0 = R_H : s
\]

Where:

\(W\) = Stabilizer slot width
\(x_0\) = Radial distance between the outer stabilizer lip and the heat shield, as seen in **Figure 9**, \(\approx \frac{x_1}{2}\)

Thus, the average radius of each stabilizer is:

\[
R_1 = x_1 + \frac{W}{2}
\]

\[
R_2 = 2x_1 + \frac{3}{2}W
\]

\[
R_3 = 3x_1 + \frac{5}{2}W
\]

## 3.7 Diffuser Design and Stabilizer Axial Spacing

Section 3.6 described the method for radial arrangement of stabilizers, assuming they are coplanar. If the stabilizers are staggered, the local blockage ratio decreases, reducing the local velocity at the stabilizer lip. This improves stability for a given stabilizer slot width.

For a **30° "V"-shaped stabilizer**, the wake decay downstream shows that static pressure has not recovered at **5 times the slot width** downstream, and aerodynamic effects still persist. At **2 times the slot width** upstream of the stabilizer, blockage also affects the flow. Therefore, in diffuser design, the stabilizer is moved **2 times the slot width** upstream, but it is assumed that the influence of each stabilizer still exists at its coplanar position (i.e., **4 times the slot width** downstream). The diffuser section containing the stabilizers is then designed with a constant equivalent flow area.

When stabilizers are moved upstream into the diffuser, their relative positions are maintained by moving along flow lines according to the **Area Rule** method. After diffuser design, even if it is an equal-area design, it must be demonstrated that the diffuser operates stably.

It is assumed that each stabilizer divides the diffuser into annular flow channels of different diameters. First, consider the upstream diffuser formed by the inner stabilizer, assuming a fully developed boundary layer displacement thickness of \(\frac{\delta^*}{W_1} = 0.0625\). The maximum effective wall angle \(\phi_1\) for non-separated flow can then be estimated from **Figure 10**. Considering the boundary layer growth rate from **Figure 11**, this calculation is repeated for each subsequent channel. As a precaution, the growth rate is typically doubled to ensure stable channels.

The maximum allowable angle for each channel is then compared with the actual design value.

This ensures that the diffuser is stable and has the minimum total length.

The selected afterburner configuration for the Spey MK202 consists of individually fueled flame stabilizers and a main afterburner fuel manifold located upstream of these flame stabilizers. The design of the pilot flame stabilizer is described in Reference [2], and the arrangement and design of the main afterburner fuel manifold are detailed in Reference [3].

# 4.0 Performance Estimation

Section 3 outlined the basic design of the afterburning system. At this point, it is necessary to estimate the performance achievable with this design. Performance verification determines whether the required thrust has been achieved or if design modifications are needed.

Preliminary calculations determine the approximate cold-state losses of the system.

## 4.1 Cold-State Pressure Loss Estimation

The cold-state pressure loss of the afterburning system is determined by the diffuser structure, stabilizer blockage ratio, fuel manifold blockage ratio, struts, delivery pipes, connectors, and ignition devices. At the initial design stage, most of these factors are not yet determined. Therefore, in preliminary estimations, cold-state losses are considered to depend only on the stabilizer blockage ratio.

Thus:

\[
\left( \frac{\Delta P}{D} \right)_1 = 2 C_D \frac{\beta}{(1 - \beta)^2}
\]

Where:

\(\Delta P\) = Cold-state pressure loss (psi)
\(D\) = Dynamic pressure head corresponding to the full cross-section of the afterburner (psi)
\(C_D\) = Stabilizer drag coefficient
= 1.0 (for 30° V-shaped slots or vaporizing stabilizers)
\(\beta\) = Stabilizer blockage ratio in the full cross-section

The pressure after loss \(P_s'\) can be determined by:

\[
P_s' = P_s - \left( \frac{\Delta P}{D} \right)_s \times D
\]

**Figure 12** shows \(\left( \frac{\Delta P}{D} \right)\) considering only the V-shaped slots, where:

\[
\frac{\Delta P}{D} = C_D \frac{\beta}{(1 - \beta)^2}
\]

Cold-state losses are sometimes expressed as a function of total pressure \(P_8\):

\[
\frac{\Delta P}{P} = \left( \frac{\Delta P}{D} \right)_1 \times \frac{D}{P_8} \%
\]

## 4.2 Combustion Efficiency \(\eta_c\) Calculation

The combustion efficiency at a given condition is estimated using a modified version of the **King efficiency relation** (Reference [4]). King's original work was based on a single flame stabilizer configuration and did not account for flame extension distance. To adapt this relation for multiple stabilizer systems, an additional term, the **Width Factor (WF)**, is added to the combustion length (L) term. This modification redefines the correlation parameter (\(\varepsilon\)) as:

\[
\varepsilon_M = \frac{P_s'^{0.6324} T_8^{1.07} (750 - V)^{0.6252}}{e^{\left( \frac{3}{L} \times \frac{WF}{2.71} \right)}}
\]

Where:

\(P_s'\) = Total pressure after cold-state loss (psia)
\(T_8\) = Mixed temperature (K)
\(V\) = Flow velocity inside the heat shield (ft/s)
\(L\) = Combustion length (in)

For this calculation, it is assumed that all stabilizers are coplanar.

The graph derived from King's data, showing the relationship over a range of "unburned" fuel-air ratios, is presented in **Figure 13**. The "unburned" fuel-air ratio is defined as:

Where:

\(f \cdot a \cdot r_{total}\) = Total fuel-air ratio used (engine + afterburning system)
\(f \cdot a \cdot r_{engine, theoretical}\) = Theoretical engine fuel-air ratio required to increase temperature from \(T_1\) to \(T_8\)

It should also be noted that the combustion efficiency used in this relation is defined as:

\[
\eta_R = \frac{T_H - T_8}{T_{TH} - T_8}
\]

Where:

\(T_H\) = Actual hot core flow temperature (°K)
\(T_{TH}\) = Theoretical hot core flow temperature (°K)

Thus, the combustion efficiency at a given fuel-air ratio for a specific condition can be estimated.

## 4.3 Afterburning Temperature (\(T_R\)) Calculation

The theoretical hot core flow temperature \(T_{TH}\) is calculated from the theoretical total fuel-air ratio (\(f \cdot a \cdot r_{total, theoretical}\)) and the engine inlet temperature \(T_1\) using temperature rise curves, where:

The hot core flow temperature \(T_H\) can be determined from Equation (21), and the afterburning temperature is then determined from the hot core flow temperature and mixed temperature using the following equation:

\[
M_{FN} \sqrt{T_R} = \left(1 - \frac{x}{100}\right) M_3 \sqrt{T_8} + M_{HN} \sqrt{T_H}
\]

Where:

\(M_{FN}\) = Total mass flow through the nozzle (lb/s)

\[
\mu = (1 + f \cdot a \cdot r) M_8
\]

\(x\) = Percentage of air used for combustion
\(M_{HN}\) = Hot core flow mass flow through the nozzle (lb/s)

\[
= \frac{x}{100} M_8 (1 + f \cdot a \cdot r_{HC})
\]

## 4.4 Combustion Zone Heat Loss Calculation

The total pressure loss due to combustion, i.e., heat loss, depends on the inlet Mach number and the square root of the temperature rise ratio, as shown in **Figures 14** and **15**. It can be seen that the loss also depends on the specific heat ratio, which in turn depends on temperature and fuel-air ratio. Using the appropriate heat loss curve (for afterburning calculations at maximum heat release rate, the value of \(\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}\) is approximately 5), the total pressure of the hot core flow nozzle (\(P_{1FN}\)) can be determined, since:

## 4.5 Afterburning Total Thrust (\(X_{GL}\)) Calculation

The afterburning total thrust (\(X_{GL}\)) consists of the thrust from two airflows, \(X_{CA}\) and \(X_{HC}\). Thus:

### 4.5.1 Cooling Air Thrust (\(X_{CA}\))

The cooling air thrust (\(X_{CA}\)) is obtained from the thrust curves in **Figure 16 (A) to (L)**, i.e., the relationship between \(\frac{X}{M \sqrt{T}}\) and \(P_N\), using the appropriate values.

Where:

\(P_{VN} = P_8'\) (psia)
\(T = T_8\) (°K)
\(p_0\) = Ambient pressure at the nozzle (14.696 psia, sea-level static condition)

### 4.5.2 Hot Core Flow Thrust (\(X_{HC}\))

The hot core flow thrust is similarly obtained from the thrust curves using the appropriate \(\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}\) value.

Where:

\[
T = T_H
\]

The calculated total thrust is then compared with the required thrust at the design condition. Typically, at this stage, the thrust is designed to be approximately **4% higher** than required to ensure a safety margin. This accounts for errors in estimating cold-state losses or situations where the engine's turbine outlet pressure and temperature are lower than the brochure-specified performance. If the designed thrust is insufficient, some modifications to the design are required. If it exceeds requirements, the design can be adjusted to reduce the size or weight of the afterburner.

## 4.6 Effect of Design Parameter Variations on Performance

The following sections describe parameters in the afterburning design that can be varied:

### 4.6.1 Length (L_B)

Variations in combustion length affect combustion efficiency and thus performance. The effect is greater at high-altitude conditions because \(\eta_c\) varies significantly with altitude. At higher afterburner pressures (sea level), this effect is smaller. The system weight is directly dependent on the total length.

### 4.6.2 Afterburner Diameter (D)

Variations in afterburner diameter affect both stability and combustion efficiency. Increasing the diameter reduces flow velocity, thereby improving stability. The effect is significant: increasing the Spey MK202 afterburner diameter by **1 inch** increases the stability parameter (S) by over **8%**. The effect on combustion efficiency is less certain, as reduced velocity improves efficiency, but greater flame extension distance may reduce it. The net result is that efficiency is not significantly affected, but each case must be evaluated on its own merits. Additionally, weight must be considered, as the weight of the afterburning system is a function of the square of the diameter.

### 4.6.3 Stabilizer Slot Width (W)

Increasing the stabilizer slot width improves both afterburner stability and combustion efficiency. The stabilizer slot width directly affects the stability parameter, and Reference [2] shows that the effect is significant under high loads (i.e., at low afterburner pressures). However, care must be taken to ensure that the afterburner blockage ratio is not too large, as increasing the blockage ratio also increases the velocity at the stabilizer lip. Beyond a certain blockage ratio, stability will begin to decrease. This is demonstrated in **Figure 17**, which shows the variation of the stability parameter with blockage ratio at various afterburner inlet free-stream Mach numbers. This figure illustrates that the optimal blockage ratio depends on the afterburner inlet Mach number and confirms the significant impact of Mach number (afterburner diameter) on stability, as mentioned in Section 4.6.2.

The effect of stabilizer slot width on combustion efficiency is less pronounced, primarily because the reduced spacing between stabilizers shortens the flame extension distance.

However, increasing the afterburner blockage ratio increases cold-state losses, reducing both non-afterburning and afterburning thrust. Afterburning thrust may be compensated by improvements in other afterburning performance aspects, but the non-afterburning pressure loss of the engine represents a continuous penalty in terms of specific fuel consumption, which may be a critical issue.

### 4.6.4 Number of Stabilizers (N)

Increasing the number of stabilizers improves combustion efficiency by reducing flame extension distance. However, if the blockage ratio is to be kept constant, as reasoned above, the stabilizer slot width must be reduced. This reduction decreases stability, leading to flameout at higher afterburner pressures (lower altitudes).

### 4.6.5 Percentage of Air Used for Combustion (\(x\))

This report recommends that for preliminary calculations of a full afterburning system using mixed air as cooling air, **90% of the air** is assumed to be used for combustion. Reducing the amount of cooling air increases \(\mu_{FN}\), thereby increasing thrust. However, reducing cooling air may cause mechanical strength issues for the heat shield. Therefore, the required air quantity is determined by the heat shield design and the maximum hot core flow temperature that may occur within the flight envelope.

## 4.7 Performance Limitations

At this stage of calculation, it is necessary to check for possible limitations on maximum performance. These limitations can be categorized into two types:

(a) Hot core flow temperature
(b) Mach number after hot core flow combustion

During the design phase, the hot core flow temperature is limited to **2175 K**, as exceeding this value may cause mechanical failure of the heat shield tail and nozzle flaps due to high radiative heat flux. Additionally, this temperature is close to the stoichiometric fuel-air ratio temperature, i.e., near the limit of combustion performance. However, due to potential poor fuel-air distribution in actual conditions, a margin is still required.

Here is the complete English translation of the provided Chinese technical document about the Spey MK202 aircraft engine, preserving all technical terminology, numerical values, equations, and structure:

---

### 4.8 Calculation of Non-Afterburning Gross Thrust and Nozzle Area

The non-afterburning gross thrust \((X_{GD})\) is calculated by comparing partially mixed thrust and fully mixed thrust, taking into account the mixing degree (K) calculated in Section 3.2.

#### Fully Mixed Case \((X_{FM}\) and \(A_{FM})\)

The fully mixed thrust \(X_{FM}\) is calculated using the pressure \(P^*\) after cold-state losses and the "mixed" state temperature and flow \((T_8, M_8)\) with the corresponding thrust curve of the \(-1\) value in Figure 16. Similarly, the nozzle area \(A_{c:M}\) is also calculated under the assumption of fully mixed conditions.

#### Unmixed Case \((X_{UM}\) and \(A_{UM})\)

The thrust in the unmixed case is calculated from the mixer outlet parameters \(M\), \(T\), \(P\), considering the cold-state pressure losses of each airflow. It is assumed that the loss for each airflow is the same as calculated in Section 4.1 for the mixed case, but expressed as \(\Delta P / P\).

Thus, the thrust \((X_2'\) and \(X_6')\) and nozzle area for each airflow are calculated using the pressure after losses \((P_2'\) and \(P_6')\) from the thrust curves.

\[
P_2' = P_2 - \left(\frac{\Delta P}{P}\right)_1 \times P_2
\]

\[
P_{6}' = P_6 - \left(\frac{\Delta P}{P}\right)_2 \times P_6
\]

The thrusts \(X_2'\) and \(X_6'\) are summed to obtain the unmixed thrust \(X_{UM}\):

\[
\Delta X_{UM} = X_2' + X_6'
\]

Similarly,

Since

\[
K = \frac{X_{FM} - X_{UM}}{X_{FM} - X_{UM}}
\]

It is also assumed that

\[
K = \frac{A_{FM} - A_{UM}}{A_{FM} - A_{UM}}
\]

Thus, the partially mixed thrust \(X_{PM}\) and area \(A_{PM}\) are calculated.

Here,

\[
A_D = A_{PM}
\]

### 4.9 Calculation of Afterburning Ratio (B)

The afterburning ratio \(B\) is defined as:

\[
B = \frac{X_{GL} - X_{GD}}{X_{GD}}
\]

*(Translator’s note: Original text incorrectly states \(P_8\) and \(P_2\).)*

### 4.10 Calculation of Afterburning Nozzle Area (\(A_{Lit}\))

The afterburning nozzle area \(A_{Lit}\) consists of the sum of the cooling air nozzle exit area and the hot core flow exit area:

\[
A_{Lit} = A_{CAN} + A_{HCN} \quad \text{(all effective areas)}
\]

The cooling air nozzle exit area is obtained from the thrust curve \(X / A P_0 \sim P_{FN} / P_0\) in Figure 16.

Here,

\[
P_{FN} = P_8'^*
\]

\[
X = X_{CA}
\]

\[
A = A_{CAN}
\]

Similarly, the hot core flow area is calculated as:

\[
P_{FN} = P_{HCN}
\]

\[
X = X_{HC}
\]

\[
A = A_{HCN}
\]

Thus, the total effective area of the nozzle in afterburning operation can be determined.

### 4.11 Calculation of Nozzle Geometric Area

Sections 4.8 and 4.10 provide the calculations for the effective nozzle area in non-afterburning and afterburning operation. The mechanical design to achieve the required geometric area requires the use of a flow coefficient, which depends on the nozzle petal angle, which is unknown at this stage. Therefore, iteration between petal angle and geometric area is required using Figures 19 and 20 to obtain the necessary effective area.

---

### 5.0 Discussion

This report describes the method used for designing the MK202 afterburning system. Using this method, the position, size, and number of flame stabilizers, as well as the diffuser in which the stabilizers are installed, can be determined. The calculation results in this report allow mechanical design to proceed, but due to practical design difficulties and unconsidered strength issues, performance must be reassessed after the preliminary design. For completeness, the Spey MK202 design calculations are listed in Appendix A.

This report does not consider the ignition system used in the Spey afterburning system. The selection and design of the ignition system are detailed in Reference [5].

### Appendix A

#### Mixer Geometry

The following conditions are assumed in the calculations:

**Bypass Flow**

\[
T_2 = 406.3 \, \text{K}
\]

*(Translator’s note: Original text incorrectly states \(P_8\).)*

**Turbine Flow**

Total area (at mixer plane) = 951 in², geometric area = 570.6 in², effective area \(C_D = 0.6\). The total effective area is apportioned to ensure equal static pressure in both airflows:

\[
A_2 \text{ effective} = 202.6 \, \text{in}^2 \equiv 337.7 \, \text{in}^2 \text{ geometric area}
\]

\[
A_6 \text{ effective} = 368 \, \text{in}^2 \equiv 613.3 \, \text{in}^2 \text{ geometric area}
\]

And \(p_2 = p_6 = 36.978 \, \text{psi (absolute)}\)

The mixer is designed with 10 mixing funnels and \(L/W = 2.0\), \(A_2 = 330 \, \text{in}^2\).

![Mixer Funnel Diagram](images/64134230295587f315b0fae5b5112aee77c97b8c195b730a94f3a2b7db9c1837.jpg)

Each mixing funnel is of the form shown above, thus:

Perimeter \(EP = (2 \times 3.8 + \pi \times 4.5) \times 10 = 217.4 \, \text{in}\)

\(L_{mix} = 75 \, \text{in}\), and \(D_{mix} \approx 28 \, \text{in}\),

For \(P_6 / P_2 = 1.052\) and \(\theta = 30^\circ\), from the figure: \(C_D = 0.576\),

Thus,

\[
\frac{\sqrt{C_D} \times EP}{D} = \frac{\sqrt{0.576} \times 217.4}{28} = 5.89
\]

Figure 4 gives a mixing funnel loss of 12.5%.

To achieve effective mixing at the nozzle, \(D_{mix}\) must be corrected. Although \(D_{mix} = 28 \, \text{in}\) at the mixer, at 45 in along the 75 in mixing length, the mixing diameter is 35 in, thus a 34 in mixing diameter is used.

\[
\frac{\sqrt{C_D} \times EP \times L}{(D_{mix})^2} = \frac{\sqrt{0.576 \times 217.4 \times 75}}{(34)^2} = 10.70
\]

Thus, \(\eta_{mix} = 83\%\).

#### State Estimation After Mixer

Since

\[
\Delta P / P = 12.5\%, \quad P_2' = 39.518 - 0.318 = 39.200 \, \text{psi (absolute)}
\]

Similarly,

\[
P_6' = 41.590 - 0.578 = 41.012 \, \text{psi (absolute)}
\]

*(Translator’s note: Original text incorrectly states 39.0.)*

#### "Mixed" State Calculation

Since

\[
Q_2' = \frac{79.4 \times \sqrt{406.3}}{202.6 \times 39.200} = 0.2015
\]

Thus,

\[
V / \sqrt{T} = 20.3
\]

Therefore,

Similarly,

\[
V_6' = 827.3 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

#### Momentum

\[
\left(\sum \frac{MV}{g} + Ap\right), \quad \text{(if i.e., Eq. 16c.7)} = \frac{79.4 \times 662.6 + 127.5 \times 827.3}{32.2} + 570.6 \times 36.75
\]

#### Enthalpy Balance: \((\sum MC_pT)\)

\[
79.4 \times 0.2396 \times 406.3 + 127.5 \times 0.2527 \times 938.8 = 206.9 \times C_{p8} \times T_8
\]

Thus,

Iterating \(T\) and \(C_p\) yields \(T_8 = 744 \, \text{K}\).

Given \(p_8 = 36.75\),

\[
= \frac{206.9 \times \sqrt{744}}{570.6 \times 36.75^{**}} = 0.2691
\]

From (1), \(p_8 = 36.748 \, \text{psi (absolute)}\)

Thus,

\[
T_8 = 744 \, \text{K}
\]

#### Determination of Flame Stabilizer Slot Width

Let minimum \(P_8 = 5 \, \text{psi (absolute)}\)

Since

\[
\frac{pWT}{V} = \frac{5}{1.0569} \times \frac{\sqrt{744}}{18.4} \times W = 7.013 \times W
\]

Thus, if limiting \((DWT \left(\frac{pWT}{V}\right) = 12.0)\), then \(W = 1.711 \, \text{in}\). Therefore, in the calculation, assume:

#### Number of Flame Stabilizers

Assume 90% of the air is used for combustion (i.e., 90% of 1075 in² area).

Equivalent radius inside heat shield = 17.549 in.

Solving the above equation yields \(N = 2.68\), thus 3 rings of flame stabilizers are used.

#### Flame Stabilizer Spacing

Equal groove loading (E.G.L.)

Here, \(x =\) distance between stabilizers = 3.54

Thus, inner stabilizer radius \(R_1 = x + \frac{W}{2} = 4.42 \, \text{in}\)

The area of each stabilizer is as follows:

Thus,

#### Diffuser (Heat Shield) Design

The Spey is designed with a diffuser (inside the heat shield) having a constant effective flow area, with stabilizers staggered upstream by twice the slot width, as shown in Figure 21.

\[
= 647.31 \, \text{in}^2, \text{ heat shield inner area}
\]

Thus, when taking the stabilizer area in the same plane, the heat shield area is:

## Section 38 (Pages 186-190)

Here is the complete English translation of the Chinese technical document about the Spey MK202 aircraft engine, preserving all technical details, numerical values, equations, and structure:

---

### Flow Area Calculation

\[
\mathrm{A_{2f/s}} = 647.31 + 48.60 + 106.66
\]

Thus,

At Plane 1, the free-stream flow area is:

At Plane 0, i.e., two slot widths upstream of the No. 1 flame stabilizer,

In these calculations, it is assumed that the area of each flame stabilizer is equal to its area at the common plane position. In reality, when moving upstream, the flame stabilizers must be shifted along the streamline, resulting in a slight reduction in area.

The position of the upstream flame stabilizer must be calculated, and the diffuser wall diameter must be precisely determined based on the actual flame stabilizer area.

### Radial Position of Staggered Flame Stabilizers

No. 3 flame stabilizer radius = 15.00 inches (unchanged)

At Plane 2:

Let the radius of the No. 2 flame stabilizer be \( \mathrm{R_1^2} \), and the radius of the No. 1 flame stabilizer be \( \mathrm{R_2^i} \). Then:

\[
\frac{(9.70)^2}{(17.55)^2} = \frac{(\mathrm{R_2^2})^2}{(15.985)^2}
\]

Thus, \( \mathrm{R_2^2} = 8.835 \) inches

Flame stabilizer area \( ^2_2 = 97.15 \) in²

Similarly: \( \mathrm{R_1^2} = 4.026 \) inches

Flame stabilizer area \( ^2_1 = 44.27 \) in²

Let the radius of the No. 1 flame stabilizer be \( \mathrm{R_1^1} \) (at Plane 1).

Then:

\( \mathrm{R_1} = 3.75 \) inches

Flame stabilizer area \( _1 = 41.23 \) in²

### Recalculation of the Oil Baffle

Since the airflow area at each flame stabilizer plane is equal,

\( \mathrm{D_{28,1,8}} = 31.69 \) inches

And \( \mathrm{A_{1f/s}} = 647.31 + 41.23 = 688.54 \) in²

\( \mathrm{D_{1\bar{5}/5}} = 29.61 \) inches

\( \mathrm{D_{0f/s}}^* \) remains equal to 28.71 inches (as before)

### Determination of Diffuser (Oil Baffle Inner Side) Stability

First, estimate the diffuser (0–1) between the inner flame stabilizer centerline and the oil baffle. Treat as an angled annular passage.

Length (L) \( \tau = 2 \times \mathrm{W} = 3.5 \) inches

At the inlet, diffuser width \( (\mathrm{W_1}) = \frac{28.71 - 7.50}{2} = 10.605 \) inches

Thus,

However, assuming \( \delta / \mathrm{W_1} = 0.0625 \), then \( \Phi' = 16°30' \), which is the maximum allowable effective angle for flow without separation.

Now assume the diffuser has an angle \( \beta \), then

Here, \( \phi \) is the actual diffuser angle.

Now,

Mean radius (R) = \( \frac{28.71 - 7.50}{2 \times 2} + 3.75 = 9.052 \)

Since for small angles, \( \beta = \) (with small inner wall angle),

Thus,

Therefore,

5.858

Let the actual wall angle be \( \alpha \).

Thus, wall angle \( \beta + \frac{\Phi}{2} = 10°26' \) maximum.

Changzhou Wu Mianping Bao

Thus,

\[
\alpha = \frac{0.90}{2 \times 3.5} = 0.1286
\]

\( \tan 0.12 = 7° \)

\( Q = 720 \, \text{gm} \)

\( 1.88\alpha = 8.11 = 18.18 = 14 \)

### Cold Loss Estimation and Pressure After Cold Loss

The cold loss of the afterburner system (\( \Delta P / D \)) is given as follows:

Given \( \beta = 30\% \), \( \Delta P / D = 1.22 \)

But,

\[
\mathrm{Q_8} = \frac{206.9 \times \sqrt{744}}{1075 \times 40.765} = 0.1288
\]

\[
(\mathrm{P / p})_8 = 1.0260
\]

But \( \mathrm{P_8} = 40.765 \), so \( D = 1.033 \)

\( \frac{\Delta P}{D} = 1.22 \)

And \( \frac{\Delta P}{P} = 3.80\% \), so \( \mathrm{P'_8} = 39.216 \) psi

### Efficiency Calculation

Width factor

Thus, \( \mathrm{W \cdot F} = 3.039 \) inches

Therefore,

![Image](images/5067f79a74558defe7ce9777b50a8b89b70cdf6dd4d8e24d7e401d161d5602c4.jpg)

\( \mathrm{P'_8^*} = 39.216 \) psi = 5647.0 psf

\[
\mathrm{P'_8^{0.324}} = 16.428
\]

\[
\mathrm{T} = 744 \, \mathrm{K} = 1339 \, \mathrm{°R}, \quad \mathrm{T^{1.07}} = 2216.4
\]

Ideal

Thus:

\[
\varepsilon_m = \frac{16.428 \times 2216.4 \times 4.513}{2.452} = 67015.8
\]

*Note: The original text incorrectly used \( \Gamma_8 \).*

### Afterburner Temperature

Since,

Thus,

\[
\therefore \angle BED = 7 \angle A = 288 = 456 \, \mathrm{K}
\]

But,

Thus,

\[
0.0663 = \frac{f \cdot a \cdot r_{\text{EAMS}} - 0.0112}{0.0112}
\]

Efficiency

\( 80.0 = W \)

But,

Thus,

\[
\eta_R = 92\%
\]

\[
0.92 (2250 - 744) = \mathrm{T_{HC}} - 744
\]

\[
\mathrm{T_{HC}} = 2129.5 \, \mathrm{K}
\]

But,

\[
0.1 \times 206.9 \times \sqrt{744} + 1.0552 \times 206.9 \times 0.9 \times \sqrt{2129.5}
\]

\[
= (0.1 \times 206.9 + 1.0552 \times 206.9 \times 0.9) \sqrt{T_R}
\]

### Heat Loss Calculation

\[
\frac{(\mathrm{M} \sqrt{\mathrm{T}})_{\text{diff}}}{(\mathrm{M} \sqrt{\mathrm{T}})_{\text{diff}}} = \frac{196.49 \times \sqrt{2129.5}}{186.21 \times \sqrt{744}} = 1.785
\]

\[
\frac{\mathrm{P_{HCN}}}{\mathrm{P_{HC}}} = 0.931
\]

### Thrust Calculation (Non-Afterburning)

**(A) Fully Mixed Thrust (\( \mathrm{X_{FM}} \)) and Area (\( \mathrm{A_{FM}} \))**

\[
\frac{\mathrm{P_{FM}}}{\mathrm{P_0}} = \frac{\mathrm{P'_8}}{\mathrm{P_0}} = 2.668,
\]

Thus,

\( \mathrm{X_{FM}} = 12782 \) lbf

\[
\frac{X}{\mathrm{A p_0}} = 2.37
\]

Similarly,

\( \mathrm{A_{FM}} = 367 \) in²

**(B) Unmixed Thrust (\( \mathrm{X_{UM}} \)) and Area (\( \mathrm{A_{UM}} \))**

Outer bypass flow:

Given,

\( \mathrm{P_2} = 39.518 \) psi (absolute) and \( \Delta P / P = 3.8\% \)

Thus,

\[
\Delta P = 1.502
\]

\( \mathrm{P'_2} = 38.016 \) psi (absolute)

\[
\frac{P_{\text{FN}}}{p_0} = \frac{\mathrm{P'_2}}{p_0} = 2.587
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{X}{\mathrm{M} \sqrt{T}} = 2.222
\]

\( X'_2 = 3556 \) lbf

Similarly,

\( \mathrm{A'_2} = 106.0 \) in²

Turbine flow:

\( \mathrm{P_8} = 41.590 \) psi (absolute)

And,

Thus,

\( \mathrm{P'_6} = 40.010 \) psi (absolute)

\[
\frac{P_{\text{FN}}}{P_0} = \frac{\mathrm{P'_6}}{P_0} = 2.722
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{X}{\mathrm{M} \sqrt{T}} = 2.295
\]

Check,

And,

Thus,

\[
\mathrm{X_{UM}} = \mathrm{X'_2} + \mathrm{X'_6} = 12622 \text{ lbf}
\]

And,

**(C) Partially Mixed Thrust (\( \mathrm{X_{PM}} \)) and Area (\( \mathrm{A_{PM}} \))**

Mixing coefficient \( K = 83\% \)

And,

\[
K = \frac{\mathrm{X_{PM}} - \mathrm{\overline{X}_{UM}}}{\mathrm{X_{FM}} - \mathrm{\overline{X}_{UM}}}
\]

Similarly,

## Section 39 (Pages 191-195)

Here is the complete English translation of the provided Chinese technical document about the Spey MK202 aircraft engine, preserving all technical details, equations, tables, and structure:

### Thrust Calculation (With Afterburner)

#### Cold Flow

\[
\frac{P_{KM}}{P_0} = \frac{P'_8}{P_0} = 2.668
\]

#### Hot Core Flow

\[
\frac{P_{FN}}{P_0} = \frac{P_{HCN}}{P_0} = 2.484
\]

\[
\frac{X}{M_{YT}} = 2.23
\]

And

\[
\frac{X}{A p_0} = 2.1
\]

Therefore, check the Mach number after combustion:

\[
Q_{HCN} = \frac{196.49 \times \sqrt{2129.5^*}}{968 \times 36.510} = 0.2566
\]

Thus, the hot core flow Mach number \( M_N = 0.439 \), which is below the maximum permissible value.

# 1.0 Introduction

Reference [1] describes the design methodology for the afterburning systems of twin-spool engines. During the design phase, it is necessary to predict the performance achievable at various guarantee points. The method used in the Spey afterburning system design to calculate attainable combustion efficiency is based on a correlation parameter derived from a modified King’s relationship. This document summarizes King’s work and explains the modifications required to the correlation parameter when applied to multi-stage flameholder systems.

## 2.0 Derivation of King’s Correlation Parameter

The parameter derived by King is based on tests of a combustor with a specific configuration, ensuring a relatively uniform fuel-air ratio throughout the afterburner test section. Combustion efficiency is expressed in terms of afterburner inlet total temperature, total pressure, flow velocity, fuel-air ratio used, and combustion length. The parameter ranges investigated in this relationship are as follows:

- **Total temperature (T):** 700 °K to 1033 °K
- **Total pressure (P):** 5.2 to 12.5 psia
- **Flow velocity (V):** 400 to 650 ft/s
- **Fuel-air ratio (F<sub>R</sub>/M<sub>UB</sub>):** 0.034 to 0.0676
- **Combustion chamber length (L):** 30 to 66 inches

The correlation parameter **ξ** is defined as:

\[
\xi = \frac{P^{0.9324} \times T^{1.07} \times (750 - V)^{0.252}}{e^{3/L}}
\]

**Units used:**
- **P:** lb/ft²
- **T:** °R
- **V:** ft/s
- **L:** ft

Figure 1 shows the curves obtained for various afterburner fuel-air ratios, where the fuel-air ratio is defined as:

\[
\frac{F_R}{M_{UB}} = \frac{\text{Afterburner fuel flow (FR)}}{\text{Unburned airflow in afterburner (M<sub>UB</sub>)}}
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{F_R}{M_{UB}} = \frac{FAR_O - FAR_{E \cdot ID}}{1 - \frac{FAR_{E \cdot ID}}{0.0676}}
\]

Where:
- **FAR<sub>O</sub>** = Overall fuel-air ratio (engine + afterburner)
- **FAR<sub>E·ID</sub>** = Ideal fuel-air ratio for engine temperature rise

## 3.0 Modification of the Efficiency Relationship for Multi-Stage Systems

Since this relationship is based on results from a simple configuration, a correction term must be included in the combustion length term to apply it to multi-stage flameholder systems. This new term, called the **Width Factor (W.F.)**, is based on the assumption that the combustion length required to achieve a given combustion efficiency under a specific set of inlet conditions depends on the radial flame propagation distance. For the test rig geometry used to determine the original relationship, the calculated W.F. value is **2.71 inches**, where W.F. is defined as:

\[
W.F. = \frac{\sum A_n \times Z_n}{\sum A_n}
\]

Where:
- **A<sub>n</sub>** = Area of combustion zone *n*
- **Z<sub>n</sub>** = Radial flame propagation distance in zone *n*

See **Figure 2**.

The modified correlation parameter is then defined as:

\[
\xi_M = \frac{P^{0.9324} \times T^{1.07} \times (750 - V)^{0.252}}{e^{(3/L \times WF/2.71)}}
\]

**Units for W.F.:** inches

By replacing the parameter **ξ** with the modified parameter **ξ<sub>M</sub>**, the curves in **Figure 1** can be used to estimate combustion efficiency.

It should be noted that the combustion efficiency calculated from these curves is defined as:

\[
\eta_c = \frac{T_R - T_E}{T_{ID} - T_E}
\]

Where:
- **T<sub>R</sub>** = Achieved afterburner exit temperature

# Spey MK202 Afterburner Catalytic Ignition System Design

**First Edition – 15 September 1976**

---

# 1.0 Abstract

This report introduces the various ignition systems commonly used in afterburners. The characteristics of each system are compared, and their advantages and disadvantages are analyzed.

The currently used catalytic ignition system of the Spey MK202 is presented, and its design and performance are discussed.

## 2.0 Ignition Systems

Three basic types of afterburner ignition systems are commonly used:

1. Hot-shot ignition
2. Spark ignition
3. Catalytic ignition

No single ignition system is superior in all aspects under all operating conditions. The most suitable system must be selected based on specific requirements. Factors to consider include:

a) Performance, ignition range, and speed
b) Blockage and weight
c) Impact on engine specific fuel consumption (and mechanical condition)
d) System lifespan
e) Applicability
f) Auxiliary requirements (high-energy exciter boxes, fuel supply, etc.)

The following sections describe the commonly used ignition systems and their advantages and disadvantages.

### 2.1 Hot-Shot Ignition

The principle of hot-shot ignition involves injecting a stream of fuel into the engine combustion chamber, typically in the primary combustion zone, to generate a hot gas jet that passes through the turbine into the afterburner system (see **Figure 1**). This method enables very short afterburner ignition times, and with further development, such systems achieve highly reliable ignition.

The main disadvantage of this method is the potential overheating of turbine outlet guide vanes. One remedy is to reduce the amount of fuel injected into the engine combustion chamber (i.e., lower the hot-shot temperature) and use a relay nozzle downstream of the turbine to increase the jet temperature. However, this complicates the fuel system, as precise timing coordination between the main nozzle and relay nozzle is required. A second method to avoid overheating turbine guide vanes is to inject the hot-shot into the third zone of the combustion chamber, where the full temperature rise occurs only after the hot gas passes through the guide vanes. However, if the residence time is shorter than the ignition delay time, the fuel may fail to ignite, making nozzle placement critical.

Additionally, this system may encounter issues at high altitudes where fuel flow requirements are very low, and nozzles are prone to coking in high-temperature environments, as well as engine damage due to nozzle failure.

The main advantages of this system are its short ignition time and high operational altitude. Furthermore, installing this system does not degrade engine performance or affect engine specific fuel consumption.

### 2.2 Spark Ignition

Spark ignition was used in the afterburner systems of early turbojet engines. The igniter is installed in the wake of the combustion chamber center cone or V-gutter flameholder. Fuel is supplied separately or, more commonly, the existing afterburner fuel is ignited by the spark.

The main advantage of this system is its simplicity, requiring no auxiliary air or fuel—only a high-energy exciter box.

This system should be capable of igniting the afterburner at altitude limits, as spark ignition can still ignite the main combustion chamber when the pressure drops to **3.5 psia**. However, this may not be achievable in afterburner systems with poor fuel preparation, necessitating more sophisticated fuel preparation devices and possibly separate fuel supply.

The high-energy exciter boxes commonly used in main combustion chambers produce sparks at a rate of approximately **60 sparks per minute**. To achieve rapid ignition in the afterburner system, the exciter box must be upgraded to achieve a higher spark rate.

The main disadvantage of spark ignition systems is the poor mechanical integrity of the igniter. The optimal ignition position is almost always in a location where the igniter would overheat during afterburner operation. This can be mitigated by immediately shutting off the ignition fuel supply after ignition, but this compromises the system’s primary advantage of simplicity.

### 2.3 Catalytic Ignition

Due to the simplicity of the fuel control system, low blockage, light weight, and suitability for operation, the MK202 selected this ignition system. Although the system’s performance was not fully determined during the design phase, it was believed that further development could meet the requirements of the Spey MK202.

Platinum is a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidation reaction between hydrocarbons and oxygen. The platinum catalytic ignition system is installed in the afterburner and supplied with a metered amount of fuel via a timer. The resulting flame is used to ignite the main afterburner fuel, after which the catalytic system fuel supply is cut off. This system achieves combustion within **3 seconds** of ignition initiation. Although it requires a separate fuel supply, the controller is simple.

The lifespan of the ignition device depends on the number of ignition cycles and engine vibration, making it difficult to determine. However, the igniter can be designed to allow easy replacement of potentially damaged components.

## 3.0 Spey Catalytic System Design

### 3.1 Discussion

The early design of the Spey catalytic igniter consisted of a catalytic assembly housed in a sleeve mounted on the engine exhaust cone, positioned in the turbine exhaust flow. The catalytic system fuel was injected via a multi-orifice spray bar located upstream of the catalytic assembly. This design imposed strict requirements on the size and arrangement of the fuel nozzles, providing a small fuel flow to trigger the catalytic assembly and a much larger flow to stabilize the flame on the igniter cone. The resulting flame had to be sufficiently strong to reach the afterburner.

The high Mach number and varying swirl of the gas flow increased fuel supply difficulties and caused igniter vibration, leading to rapid failure of the catalytic assembly.

Due to these challenges, the catalytic igniter was relocated to the center of the combustion chamber (see **Figure 2**).

### 3.2 Operating Principle

Fuel is supplied through a feed pipe inside a strut and splits into two streams near the ignition device for the catalytic system. An attenuator and filter define a small proportion of the total fuel flow (approximately **1/300**; see **Section 3.5**). This fuel stream is directed into a downstream-facing nozzle located at the throat of a Venturi tube. The fuel mixes with air flowing through the Venturi, and the resulting stoichiometric mixture is then directed through holes in the upstream plate of the catalytic assembly into a platinum satellite roller. The roller raises the temperature, producing a "cigar-shaped" flame...

## Section 44 (Pages 216-220)

Here is the complete English translation of the Chinese technical document on the Spey MK202 aircraft engine, preserving all technical details, numerical values, equations, and structure:

---

The "flow" ignites the residual fuel (299/300 of the total fuel quantity) that passes through the fuel manifold encircling the tailcone and enters the wake of the cone. The resulting flame kernel ignites the inner-ring vaporizing stabilizers, and the flame propagates to other stabilizers via inter-flame slots.

# 3.3 Design

## 3.3.1 Catalytic Igniter Tailcone

The tailcone diameter determines the stability of the catalytic igniter after ignition and may determine the minimum combustion pressure. It does not affect ignition timing.

The stability of the tailcone is determined by the parameter \( \frac{pDT}{V} \).

Where:
- \( p \) = afterburner static pressure (lb/in²)
- \( V \) = gas flow velocity (ft/s)
- \( T \) = gas temperature (°K)
- \( D \) = tailcone diameter (ft)

As shown in **Figure 3a**, the blowout point for this parameter is 10. For the Spey engine:

- \( V = 680 \) ft/s
- \( T = 720 \) °K
- \( D = 3 \frac{1}{4} \) in (0.2708 ft)

At the blowout point:
\[ p = \frac{10 \times 680}{3 \frac{1}{4} \times 720} = 2.91 \, \text{lb/in² (absolute)} \]

Thus, as long as the predetermined fuel supply is appropriate, the Spey tailcone can still operate at an afterburner pressure of 3 lb/in² (absolute).

Tests on small-scale experimental setups indicate that tailcone length affects the operational range. If the recirculation zone is too long, the primary fuel in the system cannot be ignited by the "glow" of the catalytic assembly, leading to ignition failure. If too short, fuel residence time decreases, narrowing the stability boundary.

A tailcone angle of \( 60^\circ \) is recommended, as this angle has proven suitable for conical stabilizers.

## 3.3.2 Catalytic Assembly

The parameters shown in **Figure 3b** define the operational range of the catalytic assembly. Here:

- \( \dot{m} \) = afterburner mass flow rate (lb/s)
- \( A \) = afterburner cross-sectional area (in²)
- \( p \) = afterburner static pressure (lb/in², absolute)
- \( T \) = gas temperature (°K)

The catalytic assembly reaction rate limit is \( 7.5 \times 10^{-4} \). The minimum operating pressure for the Spey catalytic assembly is:
\[ p = 2.11 \, \text{lb/in² (absolute)} \]

## 3.3.3 Fuel Introduction to the Catalytic Assembly

When the catalytic assembly is mounted on the turbine exhaust tailcone, significant variations in fuel supply to the catalytic assembly were observed. This is due to changes in the swirl intensity of the turbine exhaust flow under different flight conditions. To avoid this issue during system redesign and ensure the catalytic assembly receives a fixed, known fuel quantity, a Venturi fuel introduction device was installed upstream of the catalytic assembly. This ensures the system is insensitive to swirl. Additionally, since fuel is introduced at the throat, fuel preparation is improved.

# 3.4 Structure and Materials

The catalytic assembly structure is shown in **Figure 4**. The assembly itself consists of two rows of 20 satellite rollers, spaced apart and arranged around a central body, housed in a silicon carbide (SiC) catalytic bed cup. The satellite rollers are made of platinum-coated platinum-rhodium (20% rhodium) mesh with a thickness of 0.01 in. The central body support is made of similar material but thicker (0.030 in). The I·C silicon carbide catalytic bed cup exhibits excellent thermal shock resistance and oxidation resistance. This material contains some free silicon, which can diffuse into platinum under reducing conditions and affect its performance. Prior to use, the catalytic bed cup is oxidized at \( 1400 \, ^\circ \mathrm{C} \) to reduce the silicon diffusion rate.

The fuel-air mixture enters the catalytic assembly through holes in an upstream plate made of pyrophyllite. This material is a naturally soft mineral, easy to machine and drill. Upon heat treatment at \( 800 \, ^\circ \mathrm{C} \), it hardens.

Sandwiched between the upstream plate and the satellite rollers is a turbulence plate, also made of platinum-rhodium alloy wire mesh (30% rhodium) with a thickness of 0.020 in.

# 3.5 Fuel System

Fuel supplied to the catalytic igniter passes through a timer located outside the afterburner, allowing fuel flow for 3 seconds (see **Figure 5**). Thus, the catalytic igniter must ignite the afterburner fuel within 3 seconds of afterburner activation. Fuel is supplied via a check valve, with a bypass orifice allowing the working fuel line downstream of the valve (inside the afterburner) to connect to an external flushing line during non-afterburning operation. The total fuel flow to the catalytic igniter is regulated by a restrictor at the inlet of the supply line, where the fuel is entirely liquid. After passing through the restrictor, the flow splits to the Venturi nozzle and the tailcone fuel manifold. The required nozzle fuel flow rate is very small (measured flows as low as 0.0002 lb/s achieve maximum catalytic assembly heat release). At such low flow rates, the fuel in the line is vaporized, making the system particularly sensitive to fuel volatility. Flow rates with AVTAG fuel differ from those with AVTUR fuel. The system is tuned to favor the most commonly used AVTUR fuel; performance may degrade if AVTAG fuel is used.

# 3.6 Performance

It has been demonstrated that, as long as the predetermined fuel flow rate is appropriate (see Section 3.3.2), the catalytic assembly can operate down to 2.1 lb/in² (absolute).

The tailcone stability range from testing is shown in **Figure 6**. The igniter can operate at pressures as low as 5 lb/in² (absolute), whereas the theoretical calculation in Section 3.3.1 yielded 3 lb/in² (absolute). In practice, limited data is available to validate the upper portion of the test curve, and it can be considered that the test and theoretical predictions are essentially consistent. The predetermined fuel supply for the Spey MK202 engine’s catalytic igniter lies within the stability boundary, and ignition has been demonstrated with AVTUR or AVCAT fuels up to 7 lb/in² (absolute). Although the total predetermined fuel flow is the same with AVTAG fuel, as previously noted, volatility differences cause the catalytic assembly to cease operation at pressures around 14 lb/in² (absolute).

## Section 45 (Pages 221-225)

Here is the complete English translation of the Chinese technical document on the Spey MK202 afterburner heat shield design, including image descriptions and technical notes:

---

# **Combustion Research Report**
**CRR 12082**
**Spey MK202 Afterburner Heat Shield Design**

**First Edition – 22 September 1976**

---

## **1.0 Abstract**
Due to the high gas temperatures in the afterburner, a heat shield is required to ensure that wall temperatures do not exceed the maximum allowable value.
Mixer outlet air is supplied to the heat shield to provide external convective cooling and internal film cooling.
This document describes the method for designing the heat shield based on the required cooling airflow and presents the heat transfer calculations used to determine wall temperature.

---

## **2.0 Introduction**
At maximum afterburning conditions, **90% of the airflow** is used for combustion, while the remaining **10% is used for cooling**.

The heat shield is designed using **15% of the total inlet airflow**, with **5% reintroduced into the main combustion flow through the first four cooling rings**.

The afterburner is designed for **sea-level static conditions**, with four **single-corrugated cooling rings** in the forward section of the heat shield and four **double-wall segments** in the aft section.

To maintain the heat shield wall temperature below the material’s maximum allowable value, the cooling channels are designed with **high convective airflow velocity** and a **cooling efficiency of no less than 50%**.

---

## **3.0 Design Conditions**
- **Sea-level static conditions**
- **Total gas flow rate**: \( M = 207 \) lb/s
- **Afterburner inlet total pressure**: \( P = 39.17 \) psi
- **Afterburner inlet total temperature**: \( T_c = 740 \, \text{K} \)
- **Hot core flow temperature after 90% of air combusts with 99% efficiency**: \( T_H = 2182 \, \text{K} \)
- **Cooling airflow (10% of total at \( T_c = 740 \, \text{K} \))**: \( 20.7 \) lb/s

---

## **4.0 Assumptions**

### **4.1 Hot Gas Flow**
1. Pressure losses in the afterburner diffuser, flame stabilizer, and fuel manifold occur at the trailing edge of the **V-gutter flame stabilizer**.
2. **Blockage ratio of the stabilizer**: \( \beta = 30\% \)
3. Pressure losses due to heating are uniformly distributed along the afterburner.

### **4.2 Cooling Airflow**
1. A **5% total pressure loss** occurs along the outer surface of the heat shield in the cooling air channel, uniformly distributed along the afterburner casing.
2. **Flow coefficient for corrugated cooling slots**: \( C_D = 0.66 \)
   **Flow coefficient for double-wall cooling gaps**: \( C_D = 0.8 \)

---

## **5.0 Heat Shield Design Procedure**
The design is based on **10% of the total airflow at inlet temperature \( T_c = 740 \, \text{K} \)** as the cooling airflow. The calculated temperature of the high-temperature gas after **90% of the air combusts** is **\( T = 2182 \, \text{K} \)**.

The heat shield temperature \( T_{s} \) depends on the dimensions of the cooling air gaps, which are calculated as follows:

### **5.1 Cooling Air Gap Dimensions**
1. **Cold-state pressure loss** is calculated from the stabilizer blockage plus diffuser losses:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta P}{D} = 2 \times \frac{\beta}{(1 - \beta)^2}
   \]
2. Calculate the **cooling air total pressure \( P_c \)**, assuming a **5% pressure loss** in the cooling channel.
3. Calculate the **pressure loss due to heating** from **Figure 1**.
4. From steps 2) and 3), calculate the **post-heating total pressure \( P_H \)**, \( Q_{t1} \), \( P/p \), and **static pressure \( p_H \)**.
5. From steps 2) and 4), calculate \( P_c / p_H \) and find \( Q_c \) from the **Q-curve**.
6. Assuming **\( C_D = 0.8 \) for double-wall segments** and **\( C_D = 0.66 \) for corrugated segments**, calculate **\( A_e \), \( A_c \), and \( W \)** from \( Q_c \).

   Due to **surface friction losses** in the cooling air channels reducing the pressure differential across the cooling rings, the **cooling gap area is increased** to compensate.

   The **pressure loss due to surface friction** is:
   \[
   \Delta P = 4 \left( \frac{f l}{D_H} \right) \left( \frac{\rho V^2}{2g \times 144} \right)
   \]
   where:
   \[
   D_H = \frac{4 \pi d W}{2 \pi d}
   \]
   \[
   \rho = \frac{p \times 144}{R t}
   \]
7. From steps 5) and 6), calculate the **corrected \( P_c \), \( P_c / p_H \), and \( W \)**.
8. Calculate the **corrected \( \Delta P \)** and iteratively solve for \( W \).

**Appendix 1** provides a calculation example for the first row of cooling gaps in the double-wall segment, where:
- **Cooling airflow rate**: \( M_c = 3.81 \) lb/s
- **Gap height**: \( W = 0.120 \) in

---

## **6.0 Heat Shield Temperature**
The heat shield temperature \( T_s \) is calculated by balancing the **heat transferred from the hot gas to the wall** and the **heat removed by the cooling airflow**.

Referring to **Figure 2**, the relevant radiation and convection terms are:
\[
C_1 = h_1 (T_{w.g.e} - T_s)
\]
\[
R_1 + C_1 = R_2 + C_2
\]

### **6.1 Calculation Method for Heat Shield Temperature \( T_s \)**
1. Specify the **maximum allowable temperature for C263 material**: \( T_{s,\text{max}} = 1165 \, \text{K} \).
2. From **Figure 3**, determine the **required cooling efficiency \( \eta_c \)** to ensure \( T_s \leq 1165 \, \text{K} \).
3. Calculate the **gas-side wall temperature \( T_{w.g} \)** from **T-T** and obtain \( T = 2182 \, \text{K} \), \( T_o = 740 \, \text{K} \) from **Figure 4**.
4. From \( \eta_c \) and **Figure 5**, find **X**.
5. Calculate the **cooling length \( l \)** using:
   \[
   X = \left( \frac{m_H}{m_c} \right)^{0.8} \left( \frac{A_c}{A_H} \right)^{0.8} \left( \frac{T_H}{T_c} \right)^{0.6} \frac{l^{0.8}}{W}
   \]
6. Calculate \( T_s \) from the equilibrium equation:
   \[
   R_1 + C_1 = R_2 + C_2
   \]
   where:
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   R_1 &= 3.94 \times 10^{-4} \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T_s}{T_H} \right)^{2.5} \right] \\
   R_2 &= 0.55 \times 10^{-8} (T_s^4 - T_c^4) \\
   C_1 &= h_1 (T_{w.g.e} - T_s) \\
   C_2 &= h_2 (T_s - T_c) \\
   C_3 &= h_3 (T_w - T_c)
   \end{aligned}
   \]

   \( h_2 \) and \( h_3 \) depend on the **temperature and flow rate of the cooling air** through the cooling channel and vary with axial position. Typical values for the **first and last segments** are:

   |       | First Segment | Last Segment |
   |-------|---------------|--------------|
   | \( h_1 \) | 44.5          | 44.5         |
   | \( h_2 \) | 131.7         | 138.6        |
   | \( h_3 \) | 54.7          | 16.6         |

7. Calculate the **heat loss of the cooling air**:
   \[
   m C_p \Delta T = A (C_2 + R_2)
   \]
8. Calculate the **corrected \( T_c \), \( T_{w.g} \), and \( T_s \)**.
9. Verify that \( T_s < T_{s,\text{max}} \).
10. If \( T_s > T_{s,\text{max}} \), **increase \( W \)** and **reduce cooling length \( l \)** for the same cooling flow rate \( m_c \), then recalculate \( T_s \).
11. If \( T_s < T_{s,\text{max}} \), **reduce \( W \)** to decrease \( m_c \) and increase \( T_s \).

**Appendix 3** provides a calculation example for the first row of cooling gaps in the double-wall segment, where:
- **Heat shield inner wall temperature \( T_s \)**: \( 1106 \, \text{K} \)
- **Cooling air temperature \( T_c \)** increases from **740 K to 794 K**
- **Heat shield outer wall temperature \( T_{s,o} \)**: \( 806 \, \text{K} \)

---

## **7.0 Cooling Efficiency**
The **gas-side wall temperature \( T_{w.g} \)** and **cooling segment length \( l \)** are calculated from the **cooling efficiency \( \eta_c \)** and **X**, where:
\[
\eta_c = \frac{T_H - T_{w.g.o}}{T_H - T_c}
\]
\[
X = \left( \frac{m_H}{m_C} \right)^{0.8} \left( \frac{A_c}{A_H} \right)^{0.8} \left( \frac{T_H}{T_c} \right)^{0.6} \frac{l^{0.18}}{W}
\]

At the **initial end of the double-wall segment**, from **Figure 3**, \( \eta_c = 50\% \), and from **Figure 5**, \( X = 39.7 \).

Here is the complete English translation of the Chinese technical document about the **Spey MK202 aircraft engine**, preserving all technical terminology, numerical values, equations, table structures, and formatting:

# **Appendix 1**
## **Aerodynamic Calculation of Cooling Slot Dimensions**
### **Afterburner Operating Conditions at Sea Level Static State**

Mass flow rate:
$\mathrm{M} = 207 \ \text{lb/s}$

\[
\mathrm{T_c} = 740 \ \text{K} \qquad \frac{\mathrm{M} \sqrt{\mathrm{T}}}{\mathrm{A P}} = \mathrm{Q}
\]

\[
\mathrm{Q} = 0.134
\]

Pressure:
$\mathrm{P} = 39.17 \ \text{psia}$ (pounds per square inch absolute)
$\frac{\mathrm{P}}{\mathrm{p}} = 1.028$

Area:
$\mathrm{A} = 1075 \ \text{in}^2$
$\mathrm{p} = 38.103 \ \text{psia}$
$\mathrm{P - p} = 1.067 \ \text{psi}$

---

### **Cold Pressure Loss**

Stabilizer blockage ratio:
$\beta = 0.30$

\[
\frac{\Delta \mathrm{P}}{\mathrm{D}} = 2 \frac{\beta}{(1 - \beta)^2}
\]

\[
\frac{\Delta \mathrm{P}}{\mathrm{D}} = 1.22
\]

\[
\Delta \mathrm{P} = 1.22 \times 1.067 = 1.30 \ \text{psi}
\]

Pressure after cold loss:
$\mathrm{P} = 37.87 \ \text{psia}$

$\mathrm{Q}$ after cold loss:
$\mathrm{Q} = 0.138$

---

### **Pressure Loss Due to Heating**

Assumed cooling airflow = **10%**
$\mathrm{M_H} = 186.3 \ \text{lb/s}$ (+ fuel flow)

Overall fuel-air ratio (FAR) = **0.0615**
Engine FAR = **0.011**
Afterburner FAR = **0.0505**
Combustion efficiency $\eta_c = 99\%$ ∴ Actual FAR = **0.0510**
Afterburner fuel flow = **9.5 lb/s**
Total mass flow:
$\mathrm{M_H} = 186.3 + 9.5 = 195.8 \ \text{lb/s}$

\[
\frac{\mathrm{M_2}}{\mathrm{M_1}} \sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{T_2}}{\mathrm{T_1}}} = \frac{195.8}{186.3} \sqrt{\frac{2182}{740}} = 1.805
\]

From **Figure 1**, $\frac{\mathrm{P_2}}{\mathrm{P_1}} = 0.923$

Pressure after heating:
$0.923 \times 37.87 = 34.95 \ \text{psia}$

∴ Total $\Delta \mathrm{P} = 2.92 \ \text{psi}$, assumed to be uniformly distributed along the afterburner liner.

At the first cooling ring position:
$\frac{l}{\mathrm{L}} = 0.668$

∴ $\Delta \mathrm{P} = 0.668 \times 2.92 = 1.95 \ \text{psi}$

∴ $\mathrm{P_H} = 35.92 \ \text{psia}$

\[
\mathrm{Q} = \frac{195.8 \times \sqrt{2182}}{951 \times 35.92} = 0.2677
\]

$\frac{\mathrm{P}}{\mathrm{p}} = 1.143$
$\mathrm{p_H} = 31.43 \ \text{psia}$

---

### **Cooling Duct Pressure**

A **5% pressure loss** is uniformly distributed along the duct.

---

### **Cooling Air Slot**

Pressure ratio across the heat shield:

\[
\frac{\mathrm{P_c}}{\mathrm{p_H}} = \frac{37.86}{31.43} = 1.204 \qquad \mathrm{Q_c} = 0.3040
\]

Cooling airflow:
$\mathrm{M_c} = 3.81 \ \text{lb/s}$
Effective area:
$\mathrm{A_e} = \frac{3.81 \sqrt{740}}{0.304 \times 37.86} = 9.00 \ \text{in}^2$

Discharge coefficient:
$\mathrm{C_D} = 0.80$
∴ $\mathrm{A_C} = 11.25 \ \text{in}^2$
Slot width:
$\mathrm{W} = \frac{11.25}{\pi \times 34.8} = 0.103 \ \text{in}$

However, due to surface friction in the cooling air passage between the heat shield walls, $\frac{\mathrm{P_c}}{\mathrm{p_H}}$ will decrease.

\[
\Delta \mathrm{P} = \frac{4 \mathrm{f} l}{\mathrm{D_H}} \rho \frac{\mathrm{V}^2}{2 \mathrm{g}}
\]

Where:
$\mathrm{f} =$ surface friction coefficient = **0.006** (from **Figure 7**, at $\mathrm{Re} = 4.3 \times 10^4$)

\[
\rho = \frac{\mathrm{p}}{\mathrm{R T}} = \frac{31.31 \times 144}{96 \times 740} = 0.0635 \ \text{lb/ft}^3
\]

Segment length:
$l = 4.5 \ \text{in}$

\[
\mathrm{D_H} = \frac{4 \times \pi \times 34.8 \mathrm{W}}{2 \times \pi \times 34.8 \mathrm{W}} = 2 \mathrm{W}
\]

\[
\Delta \mathrm{P} = \frac{2 \mathrm{f} l}{\mathrm{W}} \frac{\rho \mathrm{V}^2}{2 \times 32.17 \times 144} = \frac{2 \times 0.006 \times 4.5 \times 0.0635 \times 914^2}{0.102 \times 64.34 \times 144} = 1.90 \ \text{psi}
\]

Thus, $\mathrm{P_c}$ reduces to **34.83 psia**.

\[
\frac{\mathrm{P_c}}{\mathrm{p_H}} = \frac{34.83}{31.31} = 1.112 \qquad \mathrm{Q} = 0.2445 \qquad \mathrm{A_e} = 12.17 \ \text{in}^2
\]

$\mathrm{A} = 15.21 \ \text{in}^2$
$\mathrm{W} = 0.139 \ \text{in}$

Iterative calculation of $\mathrm{W}$ and $\Delta \mathrm{P}$ yields:
$\mathrm{W} = 0.120 \ \text{in}$

---

### **Summary of Pressure Losses**
- Cold loss: $\frac{\Delta \mathrm{P}}{\mathrm{D}} = 1.22$
- Duct loss at first cooling slot row in double-wall segment
- Heat loss: $\frac{\mathrm{P_2}}{\mathrm{P_1}} = 0.92$
- **5% linear loss**

# **Appendix 2**
## **Heat Transfer Coefficients**

Radiative heat transfer from hot gas to heat shield: $\mathrm{R_1}$
Convective heat transfer from hot gas to heat shield: $\mathrm{C_1}$

At equilibrium, $\mathrm{R_1}$ and $\mathrm{C_1}$ must be balanced by convective heat transfer from the heat shield to cooling air ($\mathrm{C_2}$) and radiative heat transfer from the heat shield to the afterburner liner wall ($\mathrm{R_2}$).

The relevant terms for calculating these quantities are derived as follows:

---

### **Radiative Heat Transfer from Gas to Shield ($\mathrm{R_1}$)**

Given by the **Stefan-Boltzmann equation**:

\[
\mathrm{R_1} = 1.01 \times 10^{-8} \frac{\Gamma (1 + e_s)}{2} \left( e_H T_H^4 - a_g T_s^4 \right)
\]

Where:
$e_s = e_w = 0.7$ (emissivity of shield and wall)
$a_g = e_H \left( \frac{T_H}{T_s} \right)^{1.5}$ (gas absorptivity)

Beam length:
$l_B = 0.6 D = 1.7 \ \text{ft}$

Thus:

\[
\mathrm{R_1} = 39400 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T_s}{T_H} \right)^{2.6} \right]
\]

---

### **Internal Convection ($\mathrm{C_1}$)**

From hot gas to heat shield:

\[
\mathrm{C_1} = 0.02 \left( \frac{K}{\mu^{0.8}} \right) \left( \frac{M^{0.8}}{d^{0.2} A^{0.8}} \right) (T_{wg} - T_s) \times 3600^{0.8}
\]

Where:
$K =$ thermal conductivity of gas
$\mu =$ dynamic viscosity
$d =$ hydraulic diameter
$A =$ cross-sectional area

At $T_{wg} = 1461 \ \text{K}$:
$\frac{K}{\mu^{0.8}} = 0.263$

\[
M = 195.8 \ \text{lb/s}, \quad M^{0.8} = 68.0, \quad 3600^{0.8} = 700
\]

\[
\mathrm{C_1} = 0.02 \times 0.263 \times \frac{68.0 \times 700}{1.238 \times 4.54} (T_{wg} - T_s)
\]

Thus:

\[
\mathrm{C_1} = 44.5 (T_{wg} - T_s)
\]

---

### **Convective Heat Transfer ($\mathrm{C_2}$)**

Between inner and outer walls of the heat shield:

\[
\mathrm{C_2} = 0.02 \left( \frac{K}{\mu^{0.8}} \right) \left( \frac{m^{0.8}}{d^{0.2} A^{0.8}} \right) (T_s - T_c) \times 3600^{0.8}
\]

At $T_c = 740 \ \text{K}$:
$\frac{K}{\mu^{0.8}} = 0.218$

Thus:

\[
\mathrm{C_2} = 131.7 (T_s - T_c)
\]

When cooling air temperature rises from $T_c$ to slot exit temperature $T_{cm}$:
$\mathrm{C_2} = 134.1 (T_s - T_{cm})$

---

### **External Radiative Heat Transfer ($\mathrm{R_2}$)**

From heat shield to afterburner liner wall:

\[
\mathrm{R_2} = 1.01 \times 10^{-8} \left[ \frac{e_c e_w}{e_w + e_s (1 - e_w) \frac{d_s}{d_w}} \right] (T_s^4 - T_w^4)
\]

Where:
$e_s = 0.7$ (shield emissivity)
$e_w = 0.7$ (wall emissivity)
$d_s = \frac{34.8}{12} = 2.9 \ \text{ft}$ (shield diameter)
$d_w = \frac{37.0}{12} = 3.08 \ \text{ft}$ (wall diameter)

Thus:

\[
\mathrm{R_2} = 0.55 \times 10^{-8} (T_s^4 - T_w^4)
\]

---

### **External Convective Heat Transfer ($\mathrm{C_3}$)**

From outer wall of heat shield to cooling air:

\[
\mathrm{C_3} = 0.02 \left( \frac{K}{\mu^{0.8}} \right) \left( \frac{m^{0.8}}{d^{0.2} A^{0.8}} \right) (T_{s,o} - T_c) \times 3600^{0.8}
\]

\[
\frac{K}{\mu^{0.8}} = 0.218
\]

Thus:

\[
\mathrm{C_3} = 54.7 (T_{s,o} - T_c)
\]

### Appendix 3

#### Heat Shield Temperature Calculation Example

**At the first cooling gap of the double-wall segment**

\[
\dot{m}_C = 3.81 \text{ lb/s}
\]
\[
T_c = 740^\circ \text{K}
\]
\[
W = 0.120 \text{ in}
\]
\[
T_H = 2182^\circ \text{K}
\]
\[
\eta_c = 50\% = \frac{T_H - T_{w.g.}}{T_H - T_c}
\]

\[
\therefore T_{w.g.} = 1461^\circ \text{K}
\]

Let \( T_s = 1150^\circ \text{K} \)

Then,

\[
C_1 = 44.5 (T_{w.g.} - T_s)
\]

\[
C_1 = 13839 \text{ CHU/ft}^2 \cdot \text{h}
\]

\[
R_1 = 39400 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T_s}{T_H} \right)^{2.5} \right]
\]

\[
R_1 = 31455 \text{ CHU/ft} \cdot \text{h}
\]

\[
C_2 = 131.7 (T_s - T_c)
\]

\[
C_2 = 53997 \text{ CHU/ft}^2 \cdot \text{h}
\]

\[
R_2 = 0.55 \times 10^{-8} (T_s^4 - T_c^4)
\]

\[
(R_1 + C_1) < (R_2 + C_2)
\]

When \( T_s = 1075^\circ \text{K} \),

\[
R_1 + C_1 = 49865 \quad R_2 + C_2 = 49815
\]

i.e., \( (R_1 + C_1) \approx (R_2 + C_2) \)

Heat absorbed by the cooling air:

\[
A = 6.83 \text{ ft}
\]

Heat absorbed \( = C_2 + R_2 \)

When \( T_s = 1075^\circ \text{K} \), \( C_2 + R_2 = 49815 \text{ CHU/ft}^2 \cdot \text{h} \)

\[
\dot{m} C_p \Delta T = A (C_2 + R_2)
\]

\[
3.81 \times 3600 \times 0.2467 \times \Delta T = 6.83 \times 49815
\]

\[
\Delta T = 101^\circ
\]

The mean temperature \( T_{cm} \) is given by:

Logarithmic mean temperature difference \( \Delta T_m = \frac{(1075 - 740) - (1075 - 841)}{\log_e \left( \frac{1075 - 740}{1075 - 841} \right)} \)

\[
\Delta T_m = \frac{101}{\log_e 1.4316} = 281^\circ
\]

Mean \( T_{cm} = 1075 - 281 = 794^\circ \text{K} \)

Recalculate \( T_s \) using the increased cooling air temperature \( T_{cm} = 794^\circ \text{K} \):

Let \( T_s = 1150^\circ \text{K} \)

With higher thermal conductivity at \( T_{cm} = 794^\circ \text{K} \), the \( C_2 \) term increases, where \( \frac{A}{14^{0.8}} = 0.222 \), thus \( C_2 \) becomes:

\[
C_2 = 134.1 (T_s - T_{cm})
\]

\( C_1 \) and \( R_1 \) remain unaffected.

As \( T_{cm} \) increases, \( R_2 \) decreases.

Let \( T_s = 1100^\circ \text{K} \)

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
R_1 = 32290 & C_1 = 16065 \\
R_1 + C_1 = 48355 & \\
R_2 = 5867 & C_2 = 41035 \\
R_2 + C_2 = 46902 &
\end{array}
\]

When \( T_s = 1106^\circ \text{K} \),

\[
\begin{array}{rl}
R_1 = 32193 \\
R_1 + C_1 = 47991 \\
R_2 = 6044 \\
R_2 + C_2 = 47883 \\
(R_1 + C_1) \approx (R_2 + C_2)
\end{array}
\quad
C_2 = 41839
\]

Recalculate the temperature rise of the cooling air:

\[
\dot{m} \cdot C_p \cdot \Delta T = A (R_2 + C_2)
\]

\[
3.81 \times 3600 \times 0.2479 \Delta T = 6.83 \times 47883
\]

\[
\therefore T'_c = 836^\circ \text{K}
\]

Logarithmic mean temperature difference \( \Delta T_m = \frac{96}{\log_e 1.356} \)

\[
\Delta T_m = 315^\circ
\]

Mean \( T_{cm} = 1106 - 315 = 791^\circ \text{K} \)

**Calculation of the outer wall temperature \( T_{s.o.} \) of the heat shield**

Let \( T_{s.o.} = 800^\circ \text{K} \)

\[
C_1 = 134.1 (794 - 800)
\]
\[
C_1 = -805 \text{ CHU/ft}^2 \cdot \text{h}
\]
\[
R_1 = 0.55 \times 10^{-8} (1106^4 - 800^4)
\]
\[
R_1 = 5977 \text{ CHU/ft}^2 \cdot \text{h}
\]
\[
C_2 = 54.7 (800 - 740)
\]
\[
C_2 = 3282 \text{ CHU/ft}^2 \cdot \text{h}
\]
\[
R_2 = 0.55 \times 10^{-8} (800^4 - 740^4)
\]
\[
R_2 = 603 \text{ CHU/ft}^2 \cdot \text{h}
\]
\[
R_1 + C_1 = 5172 \text{ CHU/ft} \cdot \text{h}
\]
\[
R_2 + C_2 = 3885 \text{ CHU/ft}^2 \cdot \text{h}
\]
\[
(R_1 + C_1) > (R_2 + C_2) \quad \therefore T_{s.o.} \text{ is too low}
\]

Let \( T_{s.o.} = 820^\circ \text{K} \). At \( T_{s.o.} = 806^\circ \text{K} \),

Calculate the temperature rise of the cooling air:

Cross-sectional area \( = \frac{34.8 \pi \times 4.5}{144} \)

Heat absorbed \( = (R_2 + C_2) = 4282 \text{ CHU/ft}^2 \cdot \text{h} \) (at \( T_{s.o.} = 806^\circ \text{K} \))

\[
\dot{m} \cdot C_p \cdot \Delta T = A (R_2 + C_2)
\]

\[
\Delta T = \frac{3.42 \times 4282}{3.81 \times 3600 \times 0.2479}
\]

\[
\Delta T = 1^\circ
\]

i.e., the increase in \( T_c \) is negligible.

The afterburner liner wall is insulated, and it is assumed that there is no heat loss through the insulation material. The wall temperature \( T_w = T_c = 740^\circ \text{K} \).

**Summary of temperature calculations at the first cooling gap of the double-wall heat shield segment:**

All temperatures are in Kelvin (K).

At the hot core flow temperature \( T_H = 2182^\circ \text{K} \) and cooling efficiency \( \eta_c = 50\% \), the gas-side wall temperature \( T_{w.g.} \) at the exit of the first cooling gap of the double-wall segment is \( 1461^\circ \text{K} \), resulting in heat shield inner and outer wall temperatures of \( T_s = 1106^\circ \text{K} \) and \( 806^\circ \text{K} \), respectively.

The cooling air temperature between the two walls of the shield increases from \( T_c = 740^\circ \text{K} \) at the cooling gap inlet to \( T'_c = 841^\circ \text{K} \) at the outlet, yielding an average value of \( T_{cm} = 794^\circ \text{K} \) along this segment. The heat shield temperature at each cooling channel outlet can be calculated in the same manner, with corresponding adjustments to the heat transfer coefficients to account for the increased cooling air temperature in each segment.

The coefficients used in the radiation heat transfer terms remain unchanged, but in the convection heat transfer terms, the coefficients vary with temperature due to changes in the thermal conductivity \( K \) and viscosity \( \mu \) of the gas. However, within the temperature range used, these changes are very small.

### 1.0 Abstract

This report describes the design and layout method of the main afterburner fuel manifold used in conjunction with Rolls-Royce vaporizer stabilizers. It explains the determination of the fuel manifold dimensions and the assessment of the potential for fuel boiling. A set of typical calculations for the Spey MK202 is provided in the appendix as an example of the method's application.

### 2.0 Introduction

Reference [1] outlines the general design method for a full afterburning ratio system in turbofan engines. For variable afterburning ratio systems, the recommended combustion chamber consists of vaporizer V-gutter stabilizers (see Reference [2]) with independent fuel supply and an associated main afterburner fuel system. The latter system injects fuel into the combustion zone through annular manifolds located upstream of the stabilizers and between them. This report describes the arrangement of these main afterburner fuel manifolds and the process for determining the manifold diameter and spray hole sizes.

When the fuel manifold is exposed to the hot gas flow, particularly at low fuel flow rates, there is a possibility of fuel boiling. This boiling can cause fuel cracking, leading to carbon deposition and clogging of the manifold and nozzles. If left unchecked, it can result in poor fuel distribution from the manifold, eventually causing complete blockage of the manifold or nozzles. This document presents a method for estimating the likelihood of boiling and includes typical calculations for the Spey MK202.

### 3.0 Design Procedure

The design procedure for the fuel manifold is shown in Figure 1, assuming the system consists of simple pressure-jet nozzles on the manifold supplied by a pressure-controlled fuel flow regulator.

#### 3.1 Fuel Flow Requirements

Since the afterburner inlet parameters at off-design conditions are often unknown during the early design stages, calculations are performed for sea-level static conditions, which are typically specified as the guarantee point. Since this condition is not the maximum fuel flow state for the afterburner, the calculations include a margin to account for potential higher flow requirements (e.g., during low-altitude, high-speed flight). The fuel-air ratio \( \text{FAR}_{HC} \) for the maximum afterburning hot core flow is known (see Reference [1]), and the mass flow rate of the hot core flow \( \dot{M}_{HC} \) is also known. The fuel flow \( F_R \) can then be calculated as:

\[
F_R = \text{FAR}_{HC} \times \dot{M}_{HC}
\]

#### 3.2 Fuel Manifold Flow Number

In practical afterburner fuel control systems, various controllers are required, each with a fixed pressure loss. Thus, the available fuel pressure in the afterburner is lower than the pressure at the afterburner fuel pump outlet by an unknown amount during the early design stages. However, experience indicates that for afterburning systems at sea-level static conditions, the available pressure is approximately 400 psi. The flow number (F.NO.) used by Rolls-Royce to size nozzles is defined as:


---

## Section 49 (Pages 241-245)

Here is the complete English translation of the Chinese technical document about the Spey MK202 aircraft engine, preserving all technical details, equations, tables, and structure:

---

$$
\mathrm{F.NO.} = \frac{Q}{\sqrt{\Delta P}}
$$

Where:
- \( Q \) = fuel flow rate, gallons/hour
- \( \Delta P \) = pressure drop across the nozzle, psi

Thus, the required total flow number for the main afterburner fuel manifold can be calculated by the following equation:

$$
\mathrm{FN_T} = \frac{F_R}{\sqrt{400}}
$$

## 3.3 Flow Numbers of Individual Manifolds

The main afterburner fuel manifold is used to distribute fuel so that the fuel-air ratio in the combustion zone remains a proper constant. Therefore, fuel is distributed in proportion to the airflow in the afterburner. Assuming the mass flow per unit area through the combustor is constant, the fuel flow should clearly be distributed in proportion to the area.

Since in the Spey afterburning system the pilot flame is stabilized on annular stabilizers, the afterburner fuel supply pipes are chosen in an annular form. The areas between the centerlines of each stabilizer are calculated, and the total flow number (\( \mathrm{FN_T} \)) of the fuel manifold is distributed according to the size of each area.

Figure 2 shows three rows of planar stabilizers combined with four main afterburner fuel manifolds. These fuel supply devices can be single-channel or multi-channel, but for calculation convenience, they are treated as single-channel.

The flow numbers of the individual manifolds are \( \mathrm{FN_1} \), \( \mathrm{FN_2} \), \( \mathrm{FN_3} \), and \( \mathrm{FN_4} \), and it is assumed that each manifold is supplied with fuel in parallel from the main fuel supply pipe outside the afterburner combustor. Therefore:

$$
\mathrm{FN_T = FN_1 + FN_2 + FN_3 + FN_4}
$$

And:

$$
\mathrm{FN_1 = \frac{A_1}{A_T}, \quad FN_2 = \frac{A_{12}}{A_T}, \quad FN_3 = \frac{A_{23}}{A_T}, \quad FN_4 = \frac{A_{34}}{A_T}}
$$

$$
\mathrm{A_T = A_1 + A_{12} + A_{23} + A_{34}}
$$

Thus, the flow numbers of the manifolds positioned between each stabilizer are determined.

## 3.4 Nozzle Diameter and Number

The flow number of a single-orifice nozzle is expressed by the following equation:

$$
\mathrm{FN = 1000 \times D^2}
$$

Where \( D \) is the nozzle diameter (inches).

The flow number \( \mathrm{FN} \) of a manifold with \( N \) nozzles is:

$$
\mathrm{FN = N \times 1000 \times D^2}
$$

Therefore, there are infinitely many combinations of nozzle number and diameter that can satisfy the flow number requirement of the manifold. However, there are usually some basic requirements that must be met, which limit the selection range.

These requirements are:

1. The nozzle diameter should not be less than 0.025 inches. Below this size, nozzles are prone to clogging unless the fuel is strictly filtered. Moreover, below this size, the machining tolerance of the nozzle orifice will account for a significant proportion of the small orifice area, thereby affecting the required manifold flow number and fuel distribution.

2. The nozzle diameter should not exceed 0.04 inches to ensure good fuel preparation (droplet size is proportional to the square of the orifice diameter), especially when the pressure drop across the nozzle is low.

3. The circumferential spacing of nozzles on each manifold (proportional to \( 1/N \)) should be as close as possible to the radial spacing between nozzles or the radial distance from the nozzle to the stabilizer centerline.

4. If struts divide the manifold into annular segments, the number of nozzles should be an integer multiple of the number of struts. This allows each annular segment to be fueled by the same number of nozzles.

## 3.5 Manifold Diameter (Same Plane)

To satisfy requirement 3 in Section 3.4, the diameter of the manifold (i.e., the radial position of the nozzles) must be determined.

As previously mentioned, the design requirement for the manifold is to achieve a uniform and constant fuel-air ratio across the afterburner combustor cross-section. Therefore, the manifolds should be positioned at the area centers of each fuel supply zone. Thus, in Figure 2, Manifold 1 is placed at the center of area \( A_1 \), Manifold 2 at the center of \( A_{12} \), and so on. Here, it is assumed that the manifolds and stabilizers are coplanar. The designer can then check the manifold positions to determine whether multiple manifold rings are needed in each annular passage. For example, in the Spey afterburning system, using a single manifold ring in areas \( A_{12} \) and \( A_{23} \) would result in a radial distance exceeding 5 inches. If a 5-inch circumferential spacing is used to determine the number and diameter of nozzles, the nozzle orifice diameter would exceed the maximum allowable diameter (~0.084 inches). Therefore, in such cases, multiple manifold rings must be used to reduce the spacing. In the Spey engine, this is achieved by installing fuel spray bars on the positioned manifolds. Strictly speaking, these spray bars should have different lengths on the inner and outer sides to spray fuel toward the area center between the manifold and the V-gutter centerline. However, for manufacturing convenience, the spray bars on the Spey manifolds are made equal in length.

## 3.6 Axial Position of Manifolds

From Sections 3.4 and 3.5, the nozzle diameter and number, as well as the radial positions of the manifolds (assumed to be in the same plane), can be determined. To achieve better fuel preparation before the fuel enters the combustion zone, the manifolds are positioned at a suitable distance upstream of the stabilizers. The greater the distance, the better the fuel preparation and the more uniform the distribution. However, it must be avoided that fuel sprayed from the afterburner manifolds enters the wake region of the stabilizers, as this would affect the operating range of the flame stabilizers. Spey's experience shows that a distance of 6 to 10 inches yields optimal performance.

The manifolds are moved upstream from their coplanar position along streamlines using the "area rule" method, assuming no stabilizer blockage.

## 3.7 Manifold Cross-Sectional Diameter

As previously mentioned, a primary requirement for the manifold is to ensure a uniform and constant fuel-air ratio across the afterburner combustor cross-section. Therefore, the fuel sprayed from each manifold must be uniformly distributed circumferentially (i.e., the flow rate of each nozzle should be equal). The inner diameter of the manifold must be sufficiently large to avoid flow throttling. The manifold is made from a pipe with an inner cross-sectional area not less than 75% of the total geometric area of the nozzles to ensure this. Thus:

Since the blockage effect of the manifold affects the cold loss of the combustor, and cold loss must be kept to a minimum, the manifold cross-sectional area should be minimized while satisfying Equation (8). For an annular manifold with only one fuel inlet, the fuel flow rate through the manifold decreases with distance from the inlet. Therefore, the inner diameter of the manifold can be gradually reduced according to the decrease in fuel flow rate. This can still be handled using Equation (8), replacing \( A_{\text{total nozzles}} \) with \( \frac{1}{2} A_{\text{total nozzles}} \) when the remaining downstream nozzle area is only half of the total nozzle area.

## 3.8 Fuel Boiling Criteria

### 3.8.1 Introduction

When the fuel manifold is in a high-temperature gas flow, especially at low fuel flow rates, there is a possibility of fuel boiling. This can cause fuel cracking, leading to manifold coking and carbon deposition, resulting in deteriorated fuel distribution and even nozzle clogging. The following describes a method for estimating the possibility of fuel boiling.

Fuel boiling is most likely to occur at high altitudes with low fuel flow rates and when using high-volatility fuels (such as JP-4 type fuels). Therefore, it is necessary to know the afterburner conditions and fuel flow rates at the altitude limits of the flight envelope. Since it is uncertain where the limiting conditions occur, calculations must be performed for various flight states along the flight envelope.

### 3.8.2 Calculation Method

The method essentially involves calculating the heat exchange from the gas to the fuel to estimate the fuel inlet temperature at which boiling begins for each fuel flow rate. This is then compared with the temperatures that may be encountered in that flight state.

Assume the following parameters are known:

- \( M \): Afterburner mass flow rate, lb/s
- \( T \): Afterburner gas temperature, K
- \( P \): Afterburner total pressure, psia
- \( F \): Manifold fuel flow rate, lb/s
- \( \mathrm{FN} \): Manifold flow number
- \( D \): Manifold diameter, inches
- \( X_D \): Manifold cross-sectional diameter, inches
- \( N \): Number of orifices on the manifold
- \( D_3 \): Nozzle diameter, inches
- \( A \): Afterburner area, in²

The fuel pressure (\( P_F \)) in the manifold can be calculated from the flow number, since:

$$
\mathrm{FN} = \frac{F}{\sqrt{\Delta P}} \cdot \frac{360}{\mathrm{SG}}
$$

Where \( \mathrm{SG} \) is the specific gravity of the fuel, and

$$
P_F = \Delta P + P
$$

Thus, the value of \( X_{288} \) can be determined from Figure 3. For JP-4 fuel, an equivalent pressure \( P_{\kappa} \) must be used instead of \( P_F \), at which \( JP_1 \) fuel would vaporize at the same temperature. This can be obtained from Figure 4.

Since the manifold length \( L \) can be determined by the following equation:

$$
L = \frac{\pi D}{12}
$$

And referring to Figure 5, the equivalent length \( L^* \) of the manifold can be determined.

Since

$$
X_{T_0} = \frac{L^*}{F} \left( \frac{M X_D}{A} \right)^{0.6}
$$

The ratio \( X_{T_0} / X_{288} \) can be determined.

Using Figure 6, the fuel inlet temperature at which boiling occurs in the manifold can be determined. When using the curves in Figure 6, the equivalent saturation vapor pressure (\( P_{\kappa} \)) must be used for JP-4 fuel. The actual fuel inlet temperature is then compared with the calculated boiling-limited inlet temperature for each flight state to determine whether boiling will occur. Since each manifold has different boiling characteristics, each manifold should be calculated accordingly.

If boiling is likely to occur, the following measures must be taken:

(a) Reduce the inner diameter of the manifold.

(b) Implement segmented fuel supply at flight states where boiling may occur, i.e., supply fuel to only certain manifolds, thereby increasing the fuel flow rate in the supplied manifolds.

(c) Shield the manifolds.

The first measure is feasible as long as Equation (8) is still satisfied; if not, fuel distribution will deteriorate. Segmented fuel supply increases the fuel flow rate. A valve can be installed that cuts off fuel to certain manifolds as altitude increases, so that a given fuel quantity flows at a higher rate through the remaining manifolds. This method can be applied to all manifolds, with only one manifold (usually the innermost) supplying fuel at extreme altitudes.

The final method to prevent fuel boiling is to shield the manifolds from the hot gas flow. Calculations show that a fuel shield with a 0.1-inch gap can reduce the heat exchange rate to the fuel by a factor of 4, making this an effective method to prevent boiling. However, the shield increases the effective size of the manifold and the associated cold loss. Since cold loss must be kept to a minimum, the shielding method is not promising.

# Appendix A

The following calculations determine the fuel manifolds for a combustion device with three stabilizer stages, arranged in the same plane, as shown in Figure 7.

## 1) Fuel Flow Rate at Sea Level Static Conditions

Used fuel-air ratio = 0.0663 (hot core flow)
Hot core flow mass flow rate = 206.9 × 0.9 = 186.21 lb/s
Since \( M_{JP} = 206.9 \) lb/s, the amount of air participating in combustion = 0.9 \( M_{JP} \)
Thus, fuel flow rate (\( F_R \)) = 5,593 gallons/hour

## 2) Total Flow Number of Manifold

Flow number = \( F_R / \sqrt{\Delta P} = 5593 / 20 = 280 \)

## 3) Flow Numbers of Individual Manifolds

Area calculations at the stabilizer plane yield the following areas and flow distribution ratios:

| Region | Area (in²) | % | Manifold Flow Number |
|--------|------------|----|-----------------------|
| Centerline to inner stabilizer (No. 1) | 60.13 | 6.32 | 17.70 |
| No. 1 to No. 2 stabilizer | 230.91 | 24.28 | 67.98 |
| No. 2 to No. 3 stabilizer | 406.42 | 42.73 | 119.64 |
| No. 3 stabilizer to heat shield | 253.69 | 26.67 | 74.68 |
| **Total** | **951.50** | | **280.00** |

## 4) Manifold Diameter (Same Plane)

Since the manifolds are positioned at the centers of the annular bands formed by the stabilizer centerlines, the area inside Manifold 1 = 60.13 / 2 = 30.065 in², diameter (\( D_1 \)) = 6.187 inches
The area inside Manifold 2 = 60.13 + 1/2 (230.91) = 175.59 in², diameter (\( D_2 \)) = 14.951 inches
Similarly, \( D_3 = 25.086 \) inches, \( D_4 = 32.397 \) inches

If a single manifold ring arrangement is used between No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 stabilizers, the radial distance from the nozzle to the stabilizer centerline is 3.1 inches and 2.9 inches, and the distance from Manifold 1 to Stabilizer 1 and from Manifold 4 to Stabilizer 3 is 1.3 inches each. For such a structural form, radial spray bars are installed on the inner and outer sides of Manifolds 2 and 3 to achieve two spray bar nozzle pitch circle diameters to coordinate the radial spacing. The spray bars are designed so that nozzles can be positioned along their length up to 1 inch from the manifold centerline to facilitate optimal design. An arbitrary nozzle position was chosen for the first test.

## 5) Actual Manifold Diameters

The manifolds are arranged at diameters \( D_1 \), \( D_{23} \), \( D_3 \), and \( D_4 \) in the same plane, as shown in Figure 8. The inner three rings require upstream movement along streamlines into the fuel-shielded diffuser.

Thus,

$$
\frac{(25.026)^2}{(34.80)^2} = \frac{(D'_3)^2}{(28.40)^2}
$$

Therefore, \( D'_3 = 20.47 \) inches

The same method is used for Manifold 2. However, since the innermost manifold (No. 1) is located upstream of the fuel shield leading edge, the calculation for Manifold 1 is performed based on the original diffuser dimensions.

Thus,

$$
\frac{(D_1)^2}{(D_{D4})^2} = \frac{(D'_1)^2}{(D_{D1})^2}
$$

$$
\frac{(6.187)^2}{(37.00)^2} = \frac{(D'_1)^2}{(29.70)^2}
$$

Thus, \( D'_1 = 4.97 \) inches
The calculation for \( D_2 \) yields \( D'_2 = 11.97 \) inches

## 6) Number and Diameter of Nozzles

During design, it was determined that the combustor containing the manifolds has five struts, so the number of nozzles on each manifold should be divisible by 5.

For Manifold 3, the relationship between the number and size of orifices corresponding to the required flow number is as follows:

Required flow number = 120.0 = 1000 \( D^2 N \)

| Number of Orifices (N) | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 |
|------------------------|----|----|----|----|
| Size (D) | 0.0490 | 0.0447 | 0.0414 | 0.0387 |
| | **Orifice too large** | | | |

It can be seen that at least 80 nozzles are required on this manifold, as fewer would result in orifice sizes that are too large. Further increasing the number of nozzles to reduce the orifice diameter has minimal effect (100 nozzles would have a diameter of 0.0346 inches), especially considering the increased weight of the spray bars.

Such calculations are performed for all manifolds to determine the minimum number of nozzles with orifice diameters less than 0.04 inches.

| Manifold Number | Number of Nozzles | Orifice Diameter (inches) |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | 10 | 0.041 |
| 2 | 45 | 0.038 |
| 3 | 80 | 0.038 |
| 4 | 55 | 0.040 |

# 7) Fuel Boiling Criteria

The calculations provided are for a condition at an altitude of **60,000 feet** and **Mach number \( M_n = 1.9 \)**, where the fuel flow rate is low. Both **JP-1** and **JP-4** fuels were considered, and calculations were performed only for the **No. 3 fuel manifold**.

At **60,000 feet altitude** and **\( M_n = 1.9 \)**, the estimated mixed afterburner inlet conditions are:

- **Mass flow rate \( \dot{M} = 56.4 \) lb/s**
- **Pressure \( P = 10.85 \) psi (absolute)**
- **Temperature \( T = 721 \, \text{K} \)**

**No. 3 afterburner fuel manifold fuel flow rate \( F = 1.0583 \) lb/s**

- **Flow number \( F.N. = 120 \)**
- **Number of nozzles \( N = 80 \)**
- **Fuel distribution factor \( X_D \) (manifold) = 0.405 (average)**
- **Diameter \( D = 20.8 \) in**
- **Afterburner cross-sectional area \( A = 1075 \) in²**

Since

\[
F.N. = \frac{F}{\sqrt{\Delta P}} \times \frac{360}{S.G.}
\]

\[
120 = \frac{1.0583}{\sqrt{\Delta P}} \times \frac{360}{0.78}
\]

Thus, **\( \Delta P = 16.57 \) psi**, and for **JP-1 fuel**, **\( P_F = 27.42 \) psi (absolute)**.

For **JP-4 fuel**, from **Figure 4**, the equivalent saturation vapor pressure is **3.50 psi (absolute)**.

Therefore, from **Figure 3**:

- For **JP-1 fuel**, **\( X_{288} = 104.0 \)**
- For **JP-4 fuel**, **\( X_{288} = 42.5 \)**

Since the manifold length \( L = \pi \times D / 12 = 5.445 \) ft,

From **Figure 5**: **\( L^*/L = 5.64 \)**

Thus, the equivalent length **\( L^* = 30.71 \) ft**

\[
X_{T0} = \frac{L^*}{F} \left( \frac{\dot{M} X_D}{A} \right)^{0.8} = \frac{30.71}{1.0583} \left( \frac{56.4 \times 0.405 \times 12}{1075} \right)^{0.8} = 12.78
\]

Therefore, for **JP-1 fuel**:

\[
\frac{X_{T0}}{X_{288}} = \frac{12.78}{104.0} = 0.1229
\]

From **Figure 6**, the inlet fuel temperature causing fuel boiling in the manifold is **450 K**.

For **JP-4 fuel**:

\[
\frac{X_{T0}}{X_{288}} = \frac{12.78}{42.5} = 0.301
\]

The inlet fuel temperature is **360 K**.

Thus, at **60,000 feet altitude** and **\( M_n = 1.9 \)**, boiling will occur in the **No. 3 fuel manifold** if:
- **JP-1 fuel** inlet temperature exceeds **177 °C**, or
- **JP-4 fuel** inlet temperature exceeds **87 °C**.

The maximum predicted fuel outlet temperature of the **Spey afterburner high-pressure pump** is **80 °C**, so **JP-1 fuel** will not boil in the manifold, while **JP-4 fuel** is close to boiling. Further calculations are required for other manifolds under this condition, and additional flight conditions should be analyzed using the same method.

| Development of the Spey MK202 Afterburner Evaporative Stabilizer |          |

**First Edition**
**22 September 1976**

# 1.0 Abstract

This report describes the benefits derived from using an evaporative gutter-type flame stabilizer, which is superior to the planar V-gutter. The design and sizing principles of Rolls-Royce’s flame stabilizer are studied, and its working principles are explained. The performance of this flame stabilizer is presented and compared with that of a simple V-gutter.

# 2.0 Introduction

Afterburner systems designed before 1960 used planar V-gutters as flame stabilizers, with fuel partially injected upstream into the gutter wake zone via fuel manifolds. Igniting this portion of fuel establishes a flame, which then propagates to the remaining fuel. Since this afterburner system approximates a premixed system, and unfortunately, the ignition limits of kerosene restrict the fuel-air ratio to no less than 0.03 for ignition. This fuel-air ratio corresponds to approximately **30% afterburning ratio** in a full afterburning turbofan engine.

During ignition of a turbofan engine, pressure fluctuations in the afterburner may adversely affect the operation of the low-pressure compressor. Indeed, if excessive pressure variations occur, the engine may surge. Modern afterburning engines with limited compressor surge margins avoid surging by designing the afterburner system to prevent excessive pressure fluctuations during ignition. This is achieved by ensuring the nozzle response is as rapid as possible and that the afterburner can ignite at the minimum afterburning fuel flow (i.e., low afterburning ratio). In V-gutter flame stabilizer systems, the so-called "split-ring fuel supply" method can reduce the minimum usable afterburning ratio below **30%**. This method involves sequentially cutting off fuel supply from the outer fuel manifolds until only the inner manifold supplies fuel, as shown in **Figure 1**. This enables a low afterburning ratio but has two drawbacks: first, the afterburning thrust varies in a stepwise manner with fuel flow, as shown in **Figure 2**. Each step corresponds to a change in the number of fuel-supplying manifolds. Second, the propulsion efficiency is low, meaning significant thrust loss (see **Appendix 1**). In this report, propulsion efficiency is defined as the ratio of the fuel required to produce a given thrust with a uniform temperature at the nozzle to the fuel required to produce the same thrust with a non-uniform temperature distribution.

Thus, an alternative system was designed and implemented, where fuel is locally supplied within the flame stabilizer, employing an **evaporative gutter-type stabilizer**.

The fuel supplied to the stabilizer is precisely controlled to ensure that the flame stabilizer operates near the **stoichiometric fuel-air ratio** across the entire flight envelope. When only this portion of fuel is supplied, a small afterburning ratio of nearly **10%** can be achieved, and due to the fuel-air ratio being close to stoichiometric, combustion efficiency is high. Additionally, since combustion occurs across the entire cross-section of the afterburner, propulsion efficiency is also high. Using this method, temperature rise can be kept below **100‰** while maintaining good stability and high combustion efficiency.

Thrust increase is achieved by injecting fuel into the airflow between the upstream fuel manifolds and the flame stabilizer, as shown in **Figure 3(a)**. This fuel can be gradually increased to allow completely smooth thrust modulation up to the maximum achievable thrust, as shown in **Figure 3(b)**. As long as the main afterburning fuel—referred to as **primary afterburning fuel**—does not enter the wake region of the flame stabilizer, the system's stability is not affected by the magnitude of the afterburning ratio.

# 3.0 Evaporative Stabilizer Design

## 3.1 Working Principle

A schematic of the evaporative stabilizer is shown in **Figure 4**.

Fuel is injected through the fuel nozzle onto a splash plate installed in the stabilizer's air intake. The air intake of the stabilizer draws air from the gas flow, forming an emulsion-like mixture with the fuel that flows into the distribution tube inside the stabilizer. Numerous pairs of small holes in the distribution tube allow the fuel-air mixture to flow along the tube into the stabilizer. Slots aligned with the small holes on the stabilizer's back serve three purposes: further atomizing the fuel with mainstream air, cooling the stabilizer walls, and enhancing the stabilizer's recirculation zone.

## 3.2 Design Principles

The design of the evaporative stabilizer largely relies on water flow simulations and sector rig test results. No direct experimental data are available for specific designs, only empirical design limits. The design principles, listed in order of importance, are as follows:

### 3.2.1 Stabilizer Gutter Width (W)

The gutter width of the stabilizer determines the final stability of the flame stabilizer and is established during the combustion chamber design phase, as referenced in **CRR12079**. All other dimensions are related to it.

### 3.2.2 Air Slot Position

Structurally, the air slots should be positioned as close as possible to the stabilizer wall to ensure proper recirculation behind the stabilizer, as shown in **Figure 5**. Water flow simulation tests indicate that if the slots are positioned too far from the wall, the recirculation zone may be disrupted, potentially reducing stability.

### 3.2.3 Slot Area (A<sub>s</sub>)

The ratio of the slot area to the total stabilizer blockage area (excluding slots) should be **0.06 ~ 0.08**. Although there are conflicting arguments regarding this relationship, early model stabilizer tests confirm that failing to adhere to this rule results in inefficient combustion of the pilot fuel.

### 3.2.4 Stabilizer Cross-Sectional Area

To maintain the correct proportion of recirculation in the V-gutter stabilizer, a V-gutter with an axial length-to-width ratio of **0.85 ± 0.05** is used. No data support this, but it is believed that excessive deviation from this ratio may reduce stability.

### 3.2.5 Distribution Tube Diameter

The ratio of the outer diameter of the distribution tube to the stabilizer gutter width should be **≤ 0.25**. This ensures an appropriate recirculation pattern. It is also important that the diameter of the distribution tube ensures its area is no less than half the area of the air intake. This ensures the air intake draws the correct amount of air.

### 3.2.6 Air Intake Size

To ensure a fixed proportion of the fuel-air mixture enters each V-gutter from the distribution tube, it is recommended that the ratio of the air intake inlet area to the V-gutter blockage area be **0.016 ± 0.004**. The relatively wide range for this ratio is due to the lack of data confirming that such tolerances allow all V-gutters in the design to use the same air intake.

### 3.2.7 Distribution Tube Orifice Area

The ratio of the total area of the distribution tube orifices to the air intake area should be no less than **1.0**. Considering the influence of the orifice flow coefficient **C<sub>D</sub>**, a value of **1.5** is recommended. If this value is below **1.0**, fuel may overflow from the air intake, causing the stabilizer to become overly fuel-rich at the air intake position.

### 3.2.8 Stabilizer Included Angle

A **30°** wall included angle is typically used for V-gutters and evaporative V-gutters. A variation of **±10°** is considered acceptable without significant adverse effects on combustion performance. Increasing the angle beyond **40°**, as proven by rig tests, can cause internal separation and disrupt the recirculation zone. Changes in the included angle can also affect cold-state pressure loss. A larger angle increases the coefficient **C<sub>D</sub>**.

### 3.2.9 Number of Distribution Tubes

The number of distribution tubes is usually determined by structural considerations such as stabilizer length and strut count. In Rolls-Royce designs, the length of the distribution tube is typically **6 ~ 8 inches**.

### 3.2.10 Distribution Tube Outlet Hole Spacing

The spacing of the distribution tube outlet holes should be selected so that the slots in the V-gutter align with each orifice. If possible, the orifices should be equally spaced circumferentially, and the gap between the ends of the distribution tubes should not be too large. Excessive gaps can cause connection issues.

### 3.2.11 Fuel Injection in the Air Intake

To ensure pilot fuel enters the distribution tube through the air intake, it is recommended to inject fuel at a **45°** angle downstream toward the splash plate.

# 4.0 Performance

The stability of the pilot flame stabilizer, where only the fuel in the stabilizer wake zone burns, is shown in **Figure 6** and compared with the operating range of a simple V-gutter stabilizer. The stability parameter (**S**) is defined as:

\[
S = \frac{pWT}{V}
\]

Where:
- **p** = Static pressure at the stabilizer lip, **lbf/in² (absolute)**
- **W** = Stabilizer gutter width, **inches**
- **T** = Gas flow temperature at the stabilizer, **°K**
- **V** = Gas flow velocity at the stabilizer lip, **ft/s**

It can be seen that the minimum operating fuel-to-unburned air ratio for the V-gutter stabilizer is **0.03**, corresponding to approximately **30% afterburning ratio**. The corresponding stability for the pilot flame stabilizer is around **0.003**, enabling a very small afterburning ratio when only burning wake fuel. Both stabilizer systems can operate down to an **S** value of **6 ~ 8**.

As long as the main afterburning fuel is injected into the combustion chamber without entering the recirculation zone, there is no reason to believe the pilot flame stabilizer cannot operate within the same stability range as that obtained from V-gutter stabilizer tests. Therefore, a third curve is drawn from the peak of the pilot flame stabilizer stability curve, extending to the rich blowout line of the V-gutter system. No experimental data confirm this assumption (other curves are derived from rig or engine test data), but it is considered reasonable from a stability perspective.

Here is the complete English translation of the Chinese technical document about the **Spey MK202** aircraft engine, preserving all technical terminology, numerical values, equations, and structural elements:

### Afterburner Static Pressure and Flow Parameter
Afterburner static pressure \( p_t = 2 p_0 \) and \( Q = \frac{M \sqrt{T}}{AP} = 0.1382 \)

#### a) Thrust in Non-Afterburning Mode
Main combustor fuel-air ratio = 0.01012
Thus, \( \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} = 3.8 \)

Since there is no heat loss in the afterburner, we have:
\[
\frac{p_N}{p_0} = 2.00
\]
where \( p_N \) is the nozzle pressure.

Therefore, \( \frac{X}{M \sqrt{T}} = 1.946 \), and thrust \( X = 51.46 M \).

#### b) Thrust of Afterburning System with Uniform Nozzle Temperature Distribution
Assume a uniform afterburner temperature rise \( \Delta T = 100 \, \text{K} \), and let \( M \) be the total air mass flow through the system. Thus, \( T_N = 800 \, \text{K} \) and \( \Delta T = (T_N - T_1) = 512 \, \text{K} \).

The total fuel-air ratio, including the main combustor and afterburner, is 0.01274.
The average temperature in the afterburner = 750 K, so \( \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} = 3.85 \).
Afterburner fuel-air ratio = 0.01274 - 0.01012 = 0.00262.

**Afterburner Heat Loss Calculation:**
\[
\frac{M_N \sqrt{T_N}}{M_4 \sqrt{T_4}} = \frac{1.01274}{1.0102} \sqrt{\frac{800}{700}} = 1.0717
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{p_N}{p_4} = 0.996, \quad \text{and since} \quad \frac{p_4}{p_0} = 2, \quad \frac{p_N}{p_0} = 1.992
\]
\[
\frac{X}{M \sqrt{T}} = 1.938, \quad \text{so thrust} = 54.81 M
\]
Afterburning thrust ratio:
\[
\left( \frac{54.81 - 51.46}{51.46} \right) \times 100\% = 6.51\%
\]

#### c) Thrust of Afterburning System with Combustion Concentrated in Central Core
Let:
- \( M \) = total air mass flow
- \( m \) = air mass flow participating in combustion in the core region (fuel-air ratio assumed to be 85% of the stoichiometric value)
- \( M' \) = remaining air mass flow (assumed to flow through the afterburner at 700 K)

Thus, \( M = M' + m \).

Core region fuel-air ratio = \( 0.85 \times 0.0676 = 0.0575 \).
Thus, core region temperature rise = 1820 K.
Nozzle core temperature = 288 + 1820 = 2108 K.
Thus, \( \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} = 4.5 \) (in the core region).
Afterburner fuel-air ratio in the core = 0.0575 - 0.01012 = 0.04738.

**Core Region Heat Pressure Loss:**
\[
\frac{M_N \sqrt{T_N}}{M_4 \sqrt{T_4}} = \frac{1.0575}{1.01012} \times \sqrt{\frac{2108}{700}} = 1.817
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{p_N}{p_4} = 0.917, \quad \frac{p_N}{p_0} = 2 \times 0.917 = 1.834
\]
\[
\frac{X}{M \sqrt{T}} = 1.840
\]

From part (a), the thrust of the non-core gas flow = \( 51.46 M' \). Therefore, for systems (b) and (c) to have equal thrust:
\[
54.81 M = 84.48 m + 51.46 M'
\]
Since \( M = M' + m \), we get \( m = 0.1015 M \).

**Propulsive Efficiency (\( \eta_p \)):**
\[
\eta_p = \frac{\text{Fuel consumed for uniform temperature rise to achieve the same thrust}}{\text{Fuel consumed for combustion in the core region only}} = \frac{0.00262}{0.0473 \times 0.1015} = 0.5453
\]
Thus, propulsive efficiency = **54.5%**.

# 1.0 Abstract

This report presents the test results of various types of mixers. The tests were conducted on a Spey simulator in an altitude test facility. The current standard 10-slot 210 square inch mixer was developed from the original 185 square inch 10-funnel mixer.

# 2.0 Conclusions

2.1 Across the entire tested altitude range and at a flight Mach number of 1.53, the 210 square inch 10-funnel mixer achieved an afterburner temperature approximately **50°C** higher before the onset of "buzz" compared to the 185 square inch 10-funnel mixer. However, the 185 square inch 10-funnel mixer, due to better matching, exhibited superior specific fuel consumption (SFC) in non-afterburning operation.

2.2 The 20-funnel mixer of the civil Spey engine, tested with an afterburner duct at a flight Mach number of 1.53, did not experience "buzz," whereas the 10-funnel mixer produced "buzz" at similar afterburner temperatures.

2.3 Compared to the 10-funnel mixer, the 10-slot mixer achieved a higher afterburner temperature limited by "buzz." Under test conditions at a flight Mach number of 1.53, the temperature difference was approximately **80°C**.

2.4 At a flight Mach number of 2.0, the 10-slot mixer achieved an afterburner temperature approximately **120°C** higher before the onset of "buzz" compared to the 10-funnel mixer.

2.5 The 10-slot mixer with a streamlined fairing reduced its effective area from 210 square inches to 185 square inches. There was no difference in the achievable afterburner temperature.

# Discussion

Tests were conducted from 30 January 1967 to 24 February 1967 in the No. 2 chamber of the altitude test facility using an afterburner simulator. During this period, various structural types were tested in addition to changes in the mixer. However, similar structures were selected to compare the impact of mixers on performance. Thus, the readings from the test graphs cannot be directly compared across different figures. Table 1 shows the comparison of mixers.

## Figure 1 - Effect of Mixer Area

This figure compares the original 185 square inch 10-funnel mixer with the 210 square inch 10-funnel mixer. It can be observed that all points are "buzz"-limited, and the 210 square inch mixer achieves an afterburner temperature approximately **50°C** higher across the entire afterburner duct pressure range. However, tests indicated that the 185 square inch mixer had the best non-afterburning SFC.

## Figure 2 - Effect of 20-Funnel Mixer

The 20-funnel civil mixer did not experience "buzz" across the entire tested altitude range at a flight Mach number of 1.53. However, despite using a higher fuel flow rate, the afterburner temperature did not increase compared to the 10-funnel mixer. Thus, although the 10-funnel mixer's performance was limited by "buzz," it was a more efficient combustor.

Although the civil mixer is referred to as a funnel type, it is almost slot-like because the funnels are not inserted into the duct. Based on this and the system's "buzz"-free characteristics, a 10-slot mixer was tested. This mixer is the type used in the Phantom Spey after removing the funnels.

## Figure 3 - Effect of 10-Slot Mixer

This figure shows that, across the entire tested altitude range at a flight Mach number of 1.53, the afterburner temperature of the 10-slot mixer was approximately **80°C** higher than that of the 20-funnel mixer. However, both configurations were limited by "buzz."

## Figure 4 - Effect of 10-Slot Mixer

At a flight Mach number of 2.0, the afterburner temperature of the 10-slot mixer was approximately **120°C** higher than that of the 10-funnel mixer. This slot-type mixer is a funnel-type mixer structure with the funnels removed. This is the configuration now installed on production engines.

## Figure 5 - Effect of 10-Slot Mixer with Streamlined Fairing

The area of the slot-type mixer is larger than the original 185 square inch funnel type. In this test, adding a streamlined fairing reduced the effective area back to 185 square inches. Across the tested altitude range at a flight Mach number of 1.53, the 10-slot mixer with the streamlined fairing showed minimal change in afterburner temperature compared to the 10-slot mixer without the fairing. This test aimed to determine if there was any impact on afterburner performance, as earlier tests had shown that the 185 square inch mixer had the best non-afterburning engine SFC.

## Figure 6 - Effect of 10-Slot Mixer with Streamlined Fairing

Figure 6 compares the performance of two mixers: one is the 210 square inch 10-funnel mixer, and the other is the 10-slot mixer with a streamlined fairing. It can be seen that across most of the tested altitude range, the 10-slot mixer with the streamlined fairing achieved a higher afterburner temperature than the 10-funnel mixer.

## Figure 7 - Effect of Clockwise Rotation of Mixer

Considering that the outlet flow pattern of the mixer relative to the combustion chamber might affect "buzz," the mixer was rotated clockwise by half a circumferential pitch. Observations indicated no impact on performance. This suggests that the combustion chamber is insensitive to changes in the mixer outlet cross-sectional flow pattern at an angle of **11°**.

| **Spey MK202 Fuel Control System – High-Pressure Fuel Pump Design Documentation** |                  |

**October 29, 1976** – **First Edition**

# Abstract

This report specifies the requirements for the high-pressure fuel pump, including technical reports that materialize these requirements and typical high-pressure fuel pump characteristics.

# 1. Introduction

The high-pressure fuel pump supplies fuel to the engine combustion chamber and injects fuel into the afterburner system during afterburner activation. Additionally, it provides fuel for cooling and servo operations for accessories and afterburner devices.

This report describes the design requirements for the high-pressure fuel pump and presents relevant data.

# 2. Initial Technical Requirements for the High-Pressure Fuel Pump

## 2.1 Requirements

The pump shall supply the engine with the required quantity of fuel at the necessary pressure.

## 2.2 Rated Speed

The pump is driven by the engine at a speed of 0.2318 times the high-pressure compressor speed. When the engine high-pressure rotor speed is 12,640 rpm, the mechanical drive output speed is 2,930 rpm. The maximum speed of the engine high-pressure rotor is 13,125 rpm.

## 2.3 Maximum Pressure

A device shall be incorporated in the pump to limit the pressure within the control system to safe operating values.

## 2.4 Pumping Capacity

The pump shall have the capability to deliver fuel according to the dimensionless fuel flow versus dimensionless parameter \( \mathrm{N_H} / \sqrt{\mathrm{\Omega T_1}} \) curves shown in **Figures 1, 2, 3** (non-afterburning) and **Figure 4** (afterburning).

At high-altitude operation, the flow rates derived from these curves must be corrected using the fuel flow correction factor provided in **Figure 5**.

The maximum fuel flow occurs at sea level (when the \( \mathrm{T_s} \) limiter is active), with a maximum fuel temperature of **60%**. The minimum fuel density is **0.716**.

When the 12th-stage boundary layer control bleed is engaged, the maximum steady-state fuel flow required for a single engine at 11,800 rpm is **11,120 lb/hr** (i.e., **1,557 gal/hr**). Additionally, during engine acceleration, the pump shall be capable of supplying fuel according to the rich-oil characteristics shown in **Figure 12**.

In addition to meeting the above engine fuel requirements, the pump must also have sufficient capacity to satisfy the additional flow demands for engine accessories. At 11,800 rpm, this flow rate is **450 gal/hr**.

## 2.5 Engine Pressure Ratio

The compressor pressure ratio versus speed curves for the engine, presented in dimensionless form, are shown in **Figures 6–11**.

## 2.6 Atmospheric Conditions

The maximum and minimum atmospheric conditions for this type of engine are represented on a specialized chart with atmospheric temperature as the scale.

## 2.7 Aircraft Operating Conditions

For this type of engine, the operating conditions in terms of altitude versus Mach number \( \mathrm{M_n} \) are plotted on a corresponding design limit flight envelope.

## 2.8 Nozzle Pressure

The nozzles are preliminarily determined to be dual-circuit nozzles with the following flow characteristics:

- Total secondary nozzle flow characteristic number = **2.5**
- Total primary nozzle flow characteristic number = **55**

The primary nozzle flow characteristic number may vary between **50 and 60**.

The flow characteristic number is given by the following equation:

\[ \text{Flow characteristic number} = \frac{\text{Fuel flow rate (lb/hr)}}{\sqrt{\text{Pressure drop (psi)}} \times \text{Specific gravity}} \]

The adopted fuel specific gravity = **0.79**

## 2.9 Fuel Temperature Range

The fuel temperature range at the pump inlet shall be **-40°C to +135°C**.

## 2.10 Low-Pressure Fuel Pressure

The fuel pump shall not exhibit cavitation when supplied with fuel at the flow rates and pressures specified in the following table:

| Flow Rate (gal/hr) | Fuel Pressure at Pump Inlet |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| 0                  | 8 psi + fuel vapor pressure |
| 500                | 9.5 psi + fuel vapor pressure |
| 1000               | 12 psi + fuel vapor pressure |
| 1500               | 17 psi + fuel vapor pressure |

The maximum low-pressure fuel pressure is:

- **Steady-state:**
  - (i) **130 psi (gauge)** at **+120°C**
  - (ii) **90 psi (gauge)** at **+135°C**
- **Transient:** **180 psi (gauge)** at **+120°C**

## 2.11 Filtration Performance

A low-pressure fuel filter is installed upstream of the fuel pump, with the following characteristics:

(i) It shall filter out at least **95%** of all **10 µm** particles.
(ii) The maximum particle size passing through the filter shall not exceed **40 µm**.

## 2.12 Fuel

The pump shall be designed to operate with any of the following fuels:

| AVTUR | JP-1 |
|-------|------|
| AVTAG | JP-4 |
| AVCAT | JP-5 |

The fuel may or may not contain **0.1%–0.15%** anti-icing additive (by volume).

## 2.13 Operation During Catapult Takeoff

During takeoff with longitudinal acceleration up to **5g** and engine attitudes from horizontal to **30°** nose-up, the pump must operate satisfactorily without periodic fluctuations or power loss. During catapult takeoff, if the throttle lever is abruptly advanced or retarded, the pump shall enable normal engine acceleration and deceleration.

## 2.14 Fuel Contamination

The designed pump shall operate without failure when using fuels specified in **Section 2.12** that comply with British Ministry specifications for contamination. However, for endurance testing, the contamination level of the fuel may follow standards mutually agreed upon by Rolls-Royce and the customer based on specific applications.

The pump’s internal components shall withstand seawater contamination.

## 2.15 Appendix Figures

# 3. Lucas P1001 High-Pressure Fuel Pump

This is a variable-stroke plunger pump. The outstanding advantage of this type of pump is its variable output flow, which can match a wide range of engine requirements. Unlike fixed-displacement pumps (e.g., gear pumps), it does not require a valve to spill excess fuel back to the low-pressure side. Because it is a variable-stroke pump, the fuel heating caused by the recirculation of large amounts of fuel during high-altitude idle flight conditions can be kept to a minimum. Another major advantage is minimal leakage, allowing the pump to provide higher output pressure. During engine ignition, this ensures better fuel atomization. Even at very low pump speeds, relatively high pressure can be maintained.

The pump structure is similar to the Lucas "D" type pump used on the civil Spey engine. The Spey MK202 engine's high-pressure fuel pump is driven by the high-speed gearbox through an appropriate gear train at 0.2318 times the high-pressure rotor speed. The plungers are axially positioned within the rotor and reciprocate as they rotate around the swashplate. By changing the swashplate angle, the pump stroke can be adjusted. The swashplate is controlled by the force of a differential-area servo piston, which opposes the spring force. The servo piston senses changes in the fuel pressure difference between the fuel regulator (C.A.S.C) and the low-pressure shaft limiter. In practice, the stroke of the high-pressure fuel pump is adjusted to maintain a balance between the pump force, the force generated by the pressure difference on both sides of the servo piston, and the spring force.

The outlet pipeline of the pump includes a spill valve or limit valve, which can bypass the entire flow of the pump if necessary. This valve is set to open at approximately 1800 psi (gauge pressure), and this pressure increases significantly with the flow through the valve. When the flow through the valve is 2200 gallons per hour, the required maximum pressure is 2800 psi (gauge pressure).

### 5. Estimation of Maximum Fuel Flow

| Technical Design Report | TDR784 |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Estimation of Maximum Fuel Flow for Spey MK202 |        |

#### Purpose
To estimate the engine fuel flow, primarily to provide technical specifications for accessory design.

#### Reason for Issue 5
The estimated maximum engine fuel flow has been revised due to changes in the boundary layer control (BLC) flight envelope (maximum equivalent airspeed of 250 knots with BLC engaged, Mach number \( M_N = 0.38 \)).

#### References
[1] Engine performance based on the latest standards, including the supplementary regulation limiting \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \) to 810.
[2] A.I.A. inlet recovery coefficient.
[3] Temperature \( T_6 \) control regulation as recommended by the Performance Department.
[4] Engine performance calculated by computer without bleed from the 7th and 12th stages of the high-pressure compressor.
[5] \( T_6 / T_1 \) control requirements derived from performance calculations and unpublished data.

#### Boundary Layer Control (BLC) Operating Envelope
BLC can be selected at any rotor speed from idle to maximum, at an equivalent airspeed of 250 knots and altitudes up to 15,000 feet. The engine inlet temperature range can be derived from the flight envelope and atmospheric temperature scales.

#### Conclusions (BLC Disengaged)
It can be demonstrated that the maximum fuel flow occurs at sea level under conditions where \( N_H \) is maximum, \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \) is maximum, and \( (p_3 - p_0) \) is maximum, coinciding at a specific ambient temperature.

At \( t_0 = 241.1 \, \text{K} \) (corresponding to \( M_N = 0.219 \)), the estimated maximum flow rate is **10,742 lb/hr**. Under this condition, the estimated high-pressure fuel pump inlet temperature is **60°C**. At this temperature, the minimum specific gravity of wide-cut fuel is **0.716**. Therefore, the maximum volumetric flow rate for steady-state engine operation is **1,500 gal/hr**.

Since the engine operating line is the same at these low temperatures, the maximum flow rate is identical regardless of whether afterburning is engaged.

For different inlet recovery coefficients, the maximum fuel flow remains unchanged, but it will correspond to different \( t_0 \) and \( M_N \) values.

To illustrate how engine fuel demand varies near the maximum fuel flow condition, **Tables 1, 2, and 3** provide fuel flow data for altitudes from sea level to 3,000 feet, Mach numbers from 0.1 to 0.3, and ambient temperatures from **ISA -53°C** to **ISA -43°C**.

#### Conclusions (BLC Engaged, Aircraft Flaps Fully Deployed, Two Engines Operating, 14.3% Bleed)
With flaps fully deployed and 12th-stage BLC engaged, the \( T_8 \) limiter controls the maximum fuel flow. Under these conditions, at \( t_0 = 221.9 \, \text{K} \) and \( t_0 = 240 \, \text{K} \), \( M_N \) up to **0.38**, the \( p_3 \) and \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \) limiters do not control fuel flow.

All fuel flow values given with BLC engaged refer to bleed from the 12th stage of the high-pressure compressor.

At \( t_0 = 221.9 \, \text{K} \) and \( M_N = 0.38 \), the estimated maximum fuel flow is **11,000 lb/hr**. The \( t_0 \) and \( M_N \) values represent the coldest sea-level weather and highest Mach number at which BLC can operate. Under this condition, the estimated high-pressure fuel pump inlet temperature is **60°C**, at which the minimum specific gravity of wide-cut fuel is **0.716**. Therefore, the maximum volumetric flow rate for steady-state engine operation at **11,800 rpm** is **1,540 gal/hr**.

Since the engine operating line is the same at these low temperatures, the maximum fuel flow is identical regardless of whether afterburning is engaged.

Because the aircraft inlet recovery coefficient at \( M_N = 0.38 \) is **0.98**, the fuel flow at **11,800 rpm** will decrease from **1,540 gal/hr** to **1,510 gal/hr**.

**Table 4** provides engine fuel demand (lb/hr) at sea level, for \( M_N \) from **0 to 0.38**, and ambient temperatures of **ISA -61.1°C** and **ISA -48°C**.

#### Single Engine Operation: 12th-Stage High-Pressure Compressor Bleed (16%)
Flight condition: \( M_N = 0.38 \), sea level, \( t_0 = 221.9 \, \text{K} \).

This condition is also limited by \( T_6 = 950 \, \text{K} \), and the maximum fuel flow at **11,800 rpm** is **11,120 lb/hr (1,557 gal/hr)**.

#### Boundary Layer Control Bleed
Boundary layer control air is obtained from either the 7th or 12th stage of the high-pressure compressor.

### 6. Determination of High-Pressure Fuel Pump Output Pressure

| Technical Design Report | TDR3934 |
|-------------------------|---------|
| Determination of High-Pressure Fuel Pump Output Pressure for Spey MK202 |         |

**Issue 3, November 18, 1965**

#### Purpose
To provide a formula for estimating the high-pressure pump output pressure under any flight condition.

#### Introduction
To determine the performance of systems using high-pressure fuel as a servo mechanism power source, it is necessary to establish the output pressure of the high-pressure pump.

#### Results
The high-pressure pump output pressure is given by the following formula:

\[
P_p = P_3 + 620 - 5.35 \times 10^{-3} F \times \frac{0.79}{S.G.} + 5.13 \times 10^{-6} F^2 \times \frac{0.79}{S.G.}
\]

Where:
- \( P_p \): High-pressure pump output pressure (psi, absolute)
- \( P_3 \): High-pressure compressor outlet pressure (psi, absolute)
- \( F \): Engine fuel flow (lb/hr)
- \( S.G. \): Fuel specific gravity

The values of \( F \) and \( P_3 \) can be determined from engine performance data under specific flight conditions.

During sudden acceleration, it can be assumed that the fuel flow exceeds the steady-state fuel flow by **30%**.

The high-pressure fuel pump is equipped with a relief valve set to a pressure **1,800 psi** higher than the pump's low-pressure side. The maximum low-side pressure of the pump is approximately **130 psi**.

#### Data Assumptions
- Main nozzle flow characteristic number: **55**
- Secondary nozzle flow characteristic number: **2.5**
- Flow characteristic number with shutdown switch fully open: **240**
- Pressure differential across CASC:
  - **620 psi** at low flow
  - **200 psi** at **2,600 gal/hr**

## 7. Flow Requirements for High-Pressure Speed-Cleaning Filter and High-Pressure Fuel Pump

**Issue 2**
**18 January 1965**

| Technical Design Report | TDR 3954 |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Spey MK202 Flow Requirements for High-Pressure Speed-Cleaning Filter and High-Pressure Fuel Pump | |

# Abstract

It has been demonstrated that the existing fuel pump’s delivery capacity exceeds the engine’s maximum fuel demand (at \( t_0 = 221.9 \, \text{K} \)) by only a small margin, as specified in the brochure.

When the engine operates at an inlet temperature of \( 247 \, \text{K} \), sufficient fuel delivery capacity is available.
The maximum flow through the speed-cleaning filter is provided in Table 1 of this report.

# Reason for Issue 2

(1) Revised estimation of the maximum fuel flow extracted by the high-pressure speed-cleaning filter from the pump.
(2) Comparison of maximum fuel demand and pump delivery capacity.
(3) Estimated maximum flow for all components, discussed in Section 7.1 of this report.

### 7.1 Summary of High-Pressure Speed-Cleaning Filter Flow

Table 1 lists the flow requirements for the engine’s high-pressure speed-cleaning filter. This flow, combined with the fuel supply required by the engine combustion chamber, equals the flow demand of the engine’s high-pressure fuel pump.

**Table 1**

| | **Component** | **Required Engine High-Pressure Fuel Flow (gallons/hour)** |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Thermal jet or catalytic igniter | 300 (instantaneous)* |
| 2 | V-type afterburner fuel regulator | With afterburner | 120* |
|   | | Without afterburner | 50* |
| 3 | Afterburner nozzle system pressure ratio actuator | 250 (instantaneous)* <br> 120 (steady-state operation) |
| 4 | Cold-start fuel | 136 (only at low fuel pressure) |
| 5 | Low-pressure regulator cooling | 20* |
| 6 | N/√T device and inlet guide vane actuator | 70* |
| 7 | Nozzle release valve readjustment piston | Engine speed below 80% | 5 |
|   | | Engine speed above 80% | 30* |

The flows shown in Table 1 do not occur simultaneously. For example, cold-start fuel is not required when afterburner ignition is initiated. The most severe combination occurs when these flows are superimposed, which happens during engine acceleration at an assumed fuel pressure of 1500 psi.

The flows marked with * in the table are additive and occur simultaneously during afterburner ignition. Thus, the total additional flow requirement for the high-pressure speed-cleaning filter is 790 gallons/hour.

Since the instantaneous flow of the pressure ratio actuator lasts only about one second, only the steady-state flow of 120 gallons/hour can be considered. Therefore, the total additional flow requirement for the speed-cleaning filter is reduced to 660 gallons/hour.

### 7.2 High-Pressure Fuel Pump Delivery Capacity

The maximum engine fuel demand occurs at a high-pressure rotor speed of 11,800 rpm. The selected Lucas fuel pump (66P1001s) operates at \( 0.2318 N_H \), with a rated flow of 1000 gallons/hour at 1000 rpm pump speed. Given the pump’s estimated volumetric efficiency of 95%, the pump’s output flow will be 2544 gallons/hour.

### 7.3 Maximum High-Pressure Fuel Demand Including Servo Flow and Leakage

(a) The engine’s maximum fuel demand occurs at sea level, with a Mach number (\( M_N \)) of 0.378 and 12-stage boundary layer control (BLC) engaged. This represents the maximum speed at which BLC can be used at a temperature of \( 221.9 \, \text{K} \). For normal operation, the calculated maximum fuel flow is 1540 gallons/hour (11,000 lb/hour at a fuel specific gravity of 0.716), and 1557 gallons/hour for single-engine operation.

(b) At sea level and a temperature of \( 247 \, \text{K} \), the latest calculated maximum fuel demand for normal engine operation is 1310 gallons/hour (9380 lb/hour), and 1324 gallons/hour (9475 lb/hour) for single-engine operation.

In addition to steady-state engine requirements, the pump must also provide:

(1) Servo flow and leakage for the fuel pump and C.A.S.C. (Compressor Airflow Scheduling Control) mechanism.
(2) Servo flow and leakage for the rest of the engine components, such as bleed valves, afterburner, and catalytic ignition devices.

Table 2 assumes conditions with 12-stage BLC engaged, \( M_N = 0.378 \), sea level, wide-cut fuel with a specific gravity of 0.716, and a pump pressure of 1500 psi.

#### 7.3.2 Single-Engine Operation – BLC Engaged

At \( t_0 = 221.9 \, \text{K} \), the engine’s steady-state fuel demand is 1557 gallons/hour. At \( t_0 = 247 \, \text{K} \), it is 1324 gallons/hour. Thus, at the maximum speed of 11,800 rpm, the pump requirements are as follows:

(a) \( t_0 = 221.9 \, \text{K} \), engine acceleration (without afterburner) – 2479 gallons/hour
    \( t_0 = 221.9 \, \text{K} \), with afterburner – 2364 gallons/hour
(b) \( t_0 = 247 \, \text{K} \), engine acceleration (without afterburner) – 2089 gallons/hour
    \( t_0 = 247 \, \text{K} \), with afterburner – 2131 gallons/hour

Margin for development and thrust improvement:

(1) \( t_0 = 221.9 \, \text{K} \), engine acceleration (without afterburner) – 65 gallons/hour
    \( t_0 = 221.9 \, \text{K} \), with afterburner – 180 gallons/hour
(2) \( t_0 = 247 \, \text{K} \), engine acceleration (without afterburner) – 454 gallons/hour
    \( t_0 = 247 \, \text{K} \), with afterburner – 412 gallons/hour

**Table 2**

| **Component** | **Fuel Flow (gallons/hour)** | | | |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| | **Engine Acceleration (No Afterburner)** | **Max. Speed with Afterburner** | | |
| | \( t_0 = 221.9 \, \text{K} \) | \( t_0 = 247 \, \text{K} \) | \( t_0 = 221.9 \, \text{K} \) | \( t_0 = 247 \, \text{K} \) |
| Engine steady-state fuel demand | 1540 | 1310 | 1540 | 1310 |

## 7.4 Discussion

The engine’s total maximum fuel flow requirements in Table 2 and Section 7.3.2 do not include any considerations for development or thrust improvement.

Under the two inlet temperature conditions mentioned above, the pump theoretically meets the requirements with the leakage amounts shown in Table 2 (leakage specifications are included in the relevant fuel system specifications). However, under \( 221.9 \, \text{K} \) weather conditions, there is only a small margin (65 gallons/hour, 4% of the engine’s maximum steady-state fuel demand), whereas at \( 247 \, \text{K} \), the margin is 412 gallons/hour.

Wherever possible, leakage should always be minimized.

### 7.5 Impact of Insufficient Fuel Supply on Engine Performance

In all conditions where the pump can meet the engine’s maximum fuel demand, the relationship between fuel flow and thrust loss is as follows:

At sea level, \( M_N = 0.378 \), with 12-stage BLC engaged, and \( t_0 = 221.9 \, \text{K} \), the normal steady-state fuel demand is 1540 gallons/hour at an operating point with a net thrust of 13,060 lb. A reduction of 100 gallons/hour in steady-state fuel flow results in a thrust loss of 340 lb.

## 8. Explanation of Afterburner Acceleration Control System Utilizing Engine Main Pump Flow

**Issue 1**
**5 January 1966**

| Technical Design Report | TDR 4167 |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Spey MK202 Explanation of Afterburner Acceleration Control Utilizing Engine Main Pump Flow | |

# Abstract

To avoid low-pressure compressor surge when selecting afterburner operation, afterburner acceleration control is required. The envisioned fuel source for providing servo power is the existing afterburner high-pressure fuel, assuming that higher-pressure engine fuel is available at high altitudes. This report investigates whether the main pump has sufficient capacity to supply 100 gallons/hour of fuel and 5 gallons/hour of steady-state leakage when afterburner operation is selected.

# Results

For the engine specified in the brochure, the Spey MK202 engine’s main fuel pump delivery capacity was studied in Report TDR 3954. Based on the latest C.A.S.C. leakage data, the capacity at maximum flow when selecting afterburner operation is as follows:

(a) \( 221.9 \, \text{K} \), cold day: 161 gallons/hour (10.5% of engine fuel demand).
(b) \( 247 \, \text{K} \), cold day: 391 gallons/hour (30% of engine fuel demand).

For the above data, a margin of 200 gallons/hour for C.A.S.C. leakage and cooling was also considered. This C.A.S.C. design includes an \( N_H \sim T_1 \) regulation mechanism.

This regulation mechanism has been phased out in the current engine. Based on measured leakage and cooling flow from previous C.A.S.C. designs, a margin of 55 gallons/hour is sufficient to meet the anticipated leakage of the new C.A.S.C. design. Therefore, if required, 145 gallons/hour is now available for the Afterburner Control Unit (ACU) while maintaining the margins in (a) and (b).

Since the 100 gallons/hour flow for the afterburner acceleration control unit is only required instantaneously when selecting afterburner operation, and the continuous leakage of this unit is approximately 5 gallons/hour, fuel extraction from the engine’s high-pressure pump can be considered. The low-pressure return line should be located downstream of the flowmeter.

**Note:** Early manufactured C.A.S.C. units may retain the \( N_{J3} \sim T_1 \) mechanism—though non-functional—and the leakage of this regulator may reach 200 gallons/hour. In any case, the additional 5 gallons/hour steady-state leakage of the afterburner acceleration control unit will not excessively reduce the pump’s delivery capacity to the point of losing development and improvement potential.

|-------------------------|----------|
| Spey MK202 Estimation of Servo Pressure Drop – Proposal to Redesign High-Pressure Pump Servo Piston to Improve AVCAT Fuel Relight Capability | |

**Issue 1**
**5 December 1969**

# Purpose

This report presents data proposing the redesign of the high-pressure pump servo piston to estimate the impact of increased pressure on the afterburner system.

### 9.1 Introduction

Lucas Gas Turbine Equipment Limited has been investigating the possibility of using a newly designed high-pressure pump servo piston to improve AVCAT fuel relight capability. This proposal will increase the required pressure for the secondary nozzle at low and high speeds while ensuring that the maximum pressure of the existing system is not exceeded.

Estimations of the servo pressure differential versus pump output pressure characteristics have been made for both the existing and redesigned servo pistons.

With the additional data provided and reference to engine performance data, the impact of the proposed pressure changes on the afterburner system can be estimated.

### 9.2 Data

#### 9.2.1 Pump Outlet Pressure

The pump outlet pressure is given by:

\[
P_p = 0.97 P_3 + 5.575 \times 10^{-6} F_M^2 \times \frac{0.79}{S.G.} + 6
\]

Where:
- \( F_M \): Main nozzle fuel flow (lb/hour)
- \( F_M = (F_B - 500) \), assuming a constant secondary nozzle fuel flow of 500 lb/hour
- \( F_B \): Engine fuel flow (lb/hour)
- S.G.: Fuel specific gravity

The estimated servo pressure differential is shown in Figures 1 and 2 of this report.

#### 9.2.2 Estimated Servo Pressure Differential vs. Pump Output Pressure Characteristics (See Figures 1 and 2 of this report)

The only operating line for servo pressure differential versus pump output pressure has been plotted on Lucas curves. This is approximate and assumes full stroke is reached at \( P_p = 1900 \) psi, meaning pump pressure \( P_p \) increases only with flow, and thus pump stroke also increases with flow. When afterburner operation is selected, the servo pressure differential may tend to fall below the characteristics shown, depending on aircraft flight conditions and engine speed. In any case, exceeding the indicated characteristics is unlikely.

| Spey MK202 Fuel Control System - CASC Design Documentation | |

**First Edition**
**October 27, 1976**

# Abstract

This report defines the requirements and design characteristics for the CASC (Combined Acceleration and Speed Control) system, including technical reports that materialize these requirements.

# 1. Introduction

The fuel control system must determine the appropriate fuel flow for the engine across a wide range of operating conditions. During start-up, acceleration, and deceleration, the control system must meet engine requirements and enable continuous operation under any flight conditions within the specified flight envelope. Additionally, it must satisfy operational and safety requirements. Specifically, the pilot must be able to move the throttle lever slowly or rapidly to any position at any time without endangering the engine, and no anticipated faults within the engine control system should pose a hazard to the aircraft.

This report outlines the general requirements of the fuel control system and applies these requirements to the Spey MK202 fuel system. It also includes the rationale for parameter selection, CASC principles and data, and relevant reference reports.

# 2. Original Technical Requirements for CASC Design

CASC – Fuel Flow Regulator for Combined Acceleration and Speed Control, abbreviated as Fuel Flow Regulator.

## 2.1 Description of Requirements

The device is required to provide the following functions:

(a) Control engine speed at all positions of the throttle lever between maximum and minimum.
(b) Control engine acceleration and deceleration to prevent surge and flameout, whether the boundary layer control is engaged or disengaged.
(c) Limit turbine exhaust temperature within a specified range via mechanical output from an electrically actuated mechanism.
(d) Limit high-pressure compressor outlet pressure to a specified value.
(e) Limit the maximum speed of the high-pressure shaft.
(f) Limit the maximum fuel flow of the engine (related to high-pressure shaft speed) to a specified value.
(g) Supply the required fuel flow to the engine at the necessary pressure.
(h) Provide appropriate fuel atomization at the nozzles.
(i) Limit the high-pressure compressor outlet temperature to a specified value via mechanical output from an electrically actuated mechanism.
(k) Limit the maximum value of \( N_L / \sqrt{T_1} \) (earlier production engines achieved this by setting an appropriate \( T_8 \) control curve).

## 2.2 Engine Description

The engine is a twin-spool, bypass-type engine designed as a powerplant for military aircraft. It is generally installed horizontally and features an afterburning system and a variable-geometry exhaust nozzle.

## 2.3 Atmospheric Conditions

The range of environmental atmospheric conditions considered in the engine design is represented on an atmospheric temperature scale chart applicable to this engine model.

## 2.4 Aircraft Operating Conditions

Flight Envelope

The engine's operating conditions, defined in terms of altitude vs. Mach number curves, are represented on an appropriate "Design-Limited Flight Envelope."

## 2.5 Engine Performance Curves

## 2.6 Engine Maximum Operating Conditions

The engine's maximum operating conditions are typically controlled as follows:

### 2.6.1 Takeoff Condition

During takeoff, the high-pressure shaft speed regulator should operate normally.

When boundary layer control is engaged, the combustion chamber temperature is limited by the maximum temperature controller. This controller adjusts the high-pressure shaft full-range speed regulator to prevent the exhaust nozzle temperature from exceeding the limits specified in the amplifier's "Original Technical Requirements" diagram. Refer to Section 2 of TDR7787C.

### 2.6.2 Entire Flight Envelope

The high-pressure compressor outlet pressure and temperature limiters can also reduce engine speed (see Sections 2.7.2 and 2.7.3, respectively).

## 2.7 Fuel System Components

### 2.7.1 High-Pressure Shaft Full-Range Speed Regulator

In early production engines, the maximum high-pressure shaft speed is limited to 12,577 rpm to allow for future increases. Between inlet total temperatures of 244 K and 340 K, the regulator must control the speed within \( \pm \frac{1}{4} \% \) of the maximum high-pressure shaft speed. Below 244 K and above 340 K, in addition to the above tolerances, the variation must not exceed \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \% \) of the maximum regulated speed of the high-pressure shaft.

In addition to the above tolerances, the effects of fuel and fuel temperature variations on the maximum high-pressure shaft speed, as specified in Section 2.13, must not exceed \( \pm \frac{1}{4} \% \) of the maximum speed.

Under standard atmospheric conditions at sea level, the high-pressure shaft ground idle speed is 6,500 rpm. Below 11,600 rpm, the allowable variation in high-pressure shaft speed increases to \( + \frac{1}{2} \% \) of the maximum speed. The control accuracy of the maximum high-pressure shaft speed must be achieved regardless of the engine's operating state.

To maintain suitable engine oil temperature, at \( M = 0.8 \), 45,000 feet, and hot-day conditions \( \Delta t_0 = 233 \, \text{K} \), the minimum high-pressure shaft idle speed required is 10,400 rpm.

### 2.7.2 High-Pressure Compressor Outlet Pressure

The fuel system includes a pressure limiter to restrict the high-pressure compressor outlet static pressure to 330 psi (gauge). When the limiter is fully engaged, the pressure variation should not exceed \( \pm 1 \) psi. During the transition between the high-pressure shaft speed regulator and the \( P_3 \) limiter, the high-pressure compressor outlet pressure variation should not exceed \( \pm \) psi. The limiter should be easily adjustable within a range of \( \pm 35 \) psi.

The device must be capable of resetting the high-pressure compressor outlet static pressure limit to 150 psi to allow for adjustments on the engine under hot-day, high-altitude operating conditions. Upon removal of the reset, the limiter should revert to its original setting and maintain the aforementioned accuracy.

High-pressure compressor outlet static pressure \( = 0.97 \times \) high-pressure compressor outlet total pressure.

The maximum temperature of the high-pressure compressor outlet air supplied to this device is 350°C.

### 2.7.3 High-Pressure Compressor Outlet Temperature

The maximum high-pressure compressor outlet temperature is required to be controlled at \( 806 \, \text{K} \pm 3 \, \text{K} \). This control is achieved by the amplifier transmitting the \( T_3 \) signal to actuate the mechanism (as in Section 2.7.1) to adjust the high-pressure shaft full-range speed regulator. This adjustment should reduce the engine's high-pressure speed to a maximum of 11,320 rpm, with a mechanical stop pin preventing any further reduction in speed. This stop pin is adjustable and can be set to any minimum speed between 11,200 and 12,200 rpm.

### 2.7.4 Low-Pressure Shaft Speed Regulator

The low-pressure shaft speed regulator serves as a safety device and does not limit the high-pressure shaft speed during normal operation.

### 2.7.5 Turbine Exhaust Temperature Limiter

The turbine exhaust temperature (\( T_6 \)) should be limited according to the program specified in the amplifier's "Original Technical Requirements." Refer to Section 2 of TDR7787C. The limiter receives the voltage error signal of the expected \( T_8 \) value from the amplifier and controls the engine's high-pressure shaft speed as described in Section 2.7.3.

### 2.7.6 F/N Limiter

In the event of a failure in the compressor outlet pressure limiter, the fuel system is required to limit the fuel flow corresponding to the engine's high-pressure shaft speed.

This value should be easily adjustable within the range of 0.79 to 1.99.

### 2.7.7 Low-Pressure Compressor Surge Limiter

To avoid low-pressure compressor surge, it is necessary to limit the maximum value of \( N_L / \sqrt{T_1} \). Earlier production engines achieved this by using an amplifier to control \( T_6 / T_1 \) at \( T_6 / T_1 = 3.79 \). Later engines can control this by maintaining \( P_3 / P_2 = \) constant, implemented pneumatically via a \( P_3 / P_2 \) switch in a readjusted CASC bellows.

### 2.7.8 Flow Control Device

The purpose of designing this device (008) is to meet the engine's required flow characteristics specified in Section 2.5 within the high-pressure shaft speed range given in Section 2.7.1, while being influenced by environmental conditions (Section 2.6), the flight envelope (Section 2.4), compressor outlet pressure (Section 2.7.2), compressor outlet temperature (Section 2.7.3), and turbine exhaust temperature (Section 2.7.5).

## Section 60 (Pages 296-300)

Here is the complete English translation of the provided Chinese technical document about the Spey MK202 aircraft engine:

---

For a given rotational speed, bleed air extraction and power offtake alter the engine's required flow characteristics.

Maximum bleed air and power extraction are as follows:

# Aircraft Control Bleed:

- 12th stage bleed – 17.3 lb/sec at maximum power, sea level static, and \( t_0 = +50^\circ \mathrm{C} \).
- 7th stage bleed – 6.25 lb/sec at maximum reheat, sea level, 140 knots/hour, and \( t_0 = \) standard atmosphere \( +25^\circ \mathrm{C} \).

# Cabin and Auxiliary Equipment Cooling:

- 12th stage bleed – 1.083 lb/sec under International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) and sea level cruise conditions.
- 7th stage bleed – 1.05 lb/sec at maximum power and maximum flight speed.

# Power Requirements:

- Hydraulic pump: 48 hp
- Constant Speed Drive (CSD): 48 hp continuous, 72 hp for 5 minutes, 96 hp for 5 seconds

For cold starts, measures must be taken to increase idle flow, achieved via a selector switch and setting a fuel bypass on the C.A.S.C (Combined Acceleration and Speed Control).

When the engine is in the following condition: boundary layer control (BLC) bleed is 16% of the high-pressure compressor mass flow, sea level, \( M_N = 0.378 \), ambient temperature \( 221.9^\circ \mathrm{K} \), and high-pressure compressor speed equals 11,800 rpm, the engine's maximum required fuel flow is 11,120 lb/hour. The estimated pump inlet temperature at this condition is 60%, with a corresponding fuel specific gravity of 0.716.

## 2.7.9 High-Pressure Fuel Pump

Requirements for the high-pressure fuel pump are included in section TDR7787A. Adjust the pressure relief valve to open when inlet pressure exceeds 1,800 lb/in². The maximum low-pressure fuel pressure is:

- Steady-state operation:
  (1) 130 lb/in² (gauge) at \( +120^\circ \mathrm{C} \)
  (2) 90 lb/in² (gauge) at \( +135^\circ \mathrm{C} \)
- Transient: 180 lb/in² (gauge) at \( +120^\circ \mathrm{C} \)

## 2.7.10 Acceleration and Deceleration Control

The fuel system must protect the engine from surge during acceleration and flameout during deceleration. Within the flight envelope (Section 2.4), using any fuel specified in Section 2.13, at any temperature and altitude, rapid movement of the power lever in either direction must not cause any abnormal engine operation.

Section 2.17 provides appropriate rich and lean characteristics at sea level static, 41,000 ft \( M_N = 0.86 \), and 68,000 ft \( M_N = 2.0 \) under ISA conditions.

When boundary layer control is selected, the acceleration control device requires readjustment. The readjustment pressure is provided by the high-pressure compressor outlet pressure signal, with a minimum signal pressure of 30 lb/in² (gauge) for the readjustment device to operate. Section 2.17.3.3 also provides rich characteristics when BLC is engaged.

Under ISA sea level static conditions, for high-pressure compressor pressure ratio only, the readjustment range should be easily adjustable between 115% and 190% of the ISA steady-state operating line (no bleed).

Under ISA sea level static conditions, the dimensionless quantity \( \mathrm{F / P_2 N} \) for rich and lean characteristics requires the following adjustment range:

- Acceleration control device rich characteristics: 115% to 144% of the steady-state operating line at ISA sea level static.
- Deceleration control device lean characteristics: 50% to 70% of the steady-state operating line at ISA sea level static.

## 2.8 Throttle Lever Angle Characteristics

Under ISA sea level static conditions, above 10,500 rpm of the high-pressure shaft, the relationship between thrust and CASC throttle lever angle should be essentially linear. Figure 14 shows the total thrust versus engine speed curve under ISA sea level static conditions. The CASC throttle lever travel from idle to maximum should be \( 58^\circ \), with an idle dead zone of \( 3^\circ \pm 1^\circ \).

## 2.9 Power Lever Torque

The torque required to operate the power lever should not exceed 12 lb·in.

## 2.10 Nozzles

The nozzle is designed to work with a duplex nozzle system having the following flow characteristic numbers:

- Total secondary nozzle flow characteristic number = 2.5
- Total primary nozzle flow characteristic number = 55

In subsequent development tests, the nozzle flow characteristic number may be adjusted within the range of 50 to 60.

The flow characteristic number is defined by the following equation:

\[
\text{Flow characteristic number} = \frac{\text{Fuel flow (lb/hr)}}{\sqrt{\text{Pressure differential across nozzle (lb/in²)}}}
\]

with a fuel specific gravity of 0.79.

The fuel control unit must include a device to ensure that the primary nozzle does not open until the secondary nozzle pressure reaches 300 lb/in² (Note: This value was later revised to 600 lb/in²).

## 2.11 Stability

Control throughout the engine's operating range should be stable according to the following technical standards:

(a) Under steady-state operating conditions, there should be no regular oscillations exceeding 0.1% of the high-pressure shaft maximum speed or irregular variations exceeding 0.2% of the engine maximum speed (peak-to-peak value).

(b) When relevant limiters are engaged, the maximum overshoot should not exceed \( 1\frac{1}{3}\% \) of the maximum high-pressure shaft speed.

It must be noted that air contained in the engine control system must not impair control stability; otherwise, it should be automatically bled from the system until unstable operation is eliminated.

## 2.12 Filtration

A low-pressure filter is installed upstream of the fuel pump. The filter has the following characteristics:

(1) Filters out at least 95% of 10-micron particles.
(2) Maximum particle size passing through the filter does not exceed 40 microns.

## 2.13 Fuel

The control unit is designed to operate with any of the following fuels:

- AVTUR JP-1
- AVTAG JP-4
- AVCAT JP-5

Fuel may or may not contain 0.1% to 0.15% (by volume) anti-icing additive.

The fuel temperature range at the control unit inlet is \(-40^\circ \mathrm{C}\) to \(+135^\circ \mathrm{C}\).

## 2.14 Operation During Catapult Takeoff

During catapult takeoff, longitudinal acceleration can reach 5g. Under engine attitudes from horizontal to 30° nose-up, the control unit must operate satisfactorily and ensure no thrust fluctuations.

During catapult takeoff and arrested landing, if the throttle lever is rapidly opened or closed, the control unit should ensure normal engine acceleration or deceleration.

## 2.15 Fuel Contamination

The control unit is designed to operate without failure using fuels specified in Section 2.13 that meet relevant British standards for contamination. However, endurance testing may be conducted according to standards mutually agreed upon by Rolls-Royce and the customer based on specific applications. Fuel may also be contaminated by seawater as per standard 88M/0001K/S.

## 2.16 Gear Ratio

Regulator speed \( (N_c) = 0.3323 \times \) engine high-pressure shaft speed

Record the cooling flow at \( P_3 = 267 \) lb/in² (absolute) and \( P_2 = 43 \) lb/in² (absolute). It should not exceed 200 gal/hr.

At \( P_3 = 267 \) lb/in² (absolute), the flow can be adjusted upward to 480 gal/hr and downward to 1350 gal/hr.

Record the altitude idle flow at the fully closed position and at 3 and 6 turns outward from this position.

## 3. Technical Requirements for CASC

The primary requirement for the fuel flow control system is that the CASC (Combined Acceleration and Speed Control) must exhibit extremely low hysteresis to achieve precise control of engine fuel flow. Secondly, variations in fuel temperature, density, and viscosity within normal ranges should have minimal impact on acceleration control and speed regulation. Additionally, the system must be easily calibrated on the test bench.

Furthermore, when the throttle lever is set to the maximum position, the engine should operate under automatic control to automatically limit the maximum values of various parameters such as \( N_H \) (high-pressure rotor speed), \( T_6 \) (high-pressure turbine inlet temperature), \( P_3 \) (high-pressure compressor outlet pressure), and \( N_L \) (low-pressure rotor speed). Engine structural integrity requirements mandate that these parameters be constrained within safe limits.

An additional requirement for the Spey-type CASC system is the capability to achieve rapid acceleration in a simple and direct manner, without relying on a large number of correction devices to overcome specific difficulties.

## 4. Design Principles

In the fuel flow regulator, acceleration control and full-range speed regulation by the pilot are combined. Thus, the acronym CASC stands for "Combined Acceleration and Speed Control."

One of the fundamental principles of CASC is the use of a dimensionless fuel flow function to control acceleration. This dimensionless fuel flow function precisely defines the permissible excess fuel supply under any operating condition.

The permissible excess fuel supply during acceleration is constrained by the onset of stall or surge and varies with engine speed and inlet conditions. This variation is complex, and control systems that rely on a single parameter (such as older fuel-air ratio systems based on compressor outlet pressure) struggle to provide a satisfactory acceleration schedule. In fact, studies of engine characteristics near the stall boundary using well-known dimensionless analysis methods indicate that to compensate for variations in operating conditions with reasonable accuracy, the acceleration fuel flow schedule must respond to three parameters. The same analysis shows that by expressing fuel flow and operating conditions in dimensionless form, the relationship \( \left( \frac{F}{P_2 \sqrt{T_2}} \sim \frac{N_H}{\sqrt{T_2}} \right) \) can be described by a single curve. This directly provides the foundation for acceleration control. Appendix 1 (Section 14) demonstrates that this can be achieved without measuring air temperature.

Of course, using dimensionless methods to handle engine stall characteristics and design acceleration control is a simplification of actual conditions and requires further clarification. In dimensionless analysis of compressor and engine characteristics, there is an additional parameter representing the effect of Reynolds number on performance. However, experience shows that this is a secondary factor and can be neglected. Another influencing factor is the ram pressure ratio, which affects engine characteristics only over a small speed range and is practically manageable. CASC is based on the principle of accounting for all factors except secondary ones and is implemented in a very simple manner, achieving an unusually satisfactory compromise between control precision and device simplicity and reliability.

As for the regulator, its purpose is to develop a fast, stable, and accurate control loop across the wide range of conditions encountered by aero engines. For the first two requirements, a proportional regulator is appropriate and offers the advantage of mechanical simplicity. However, it inherently exhibits speed droop, which, if uncorrected, can cause significant speed errors. Fortunately, CASC integrates the speed regulator with the acceleration controller. The altitude and speed parameters used in acceleration control automatically and accurately provide the reference readjustment for the speed regulator. Thus, the transient speed droop required for stability is retained, but no drift in the regulated steady-state speed occurs with changing environmental conditions.

CASC receives fuel from a variable-stroke high-pressure fuel pump. Downstream of the CASC (in the main nozzle fuel line) is a variable orifice. When the low-pressure shaft speed is excessive, this orifice moves toward the closed position (within the low-pressure shaft regulator). The high-pressure pump servo piston senses the oil pressure after the low-pressure shaft regulator on one side and the high-pressure pump outlet pressure on the other. This pressure differential is used to control the pump stroke.

Returning to the CASC, the regulator incorporates a device to distribute fuel flow between the engine's main and pilot nozzles. During engine ignition, the full pressure differential from the control pump (servo piston) acts on the pilot nozzle, sacrificing main nozzle fuel pressure to ensure good fuel atomization. At higher engine speeds, the CASC-metered fuel flow is adjusted to the appropriate value by changing the pump stroke until an appropriate pressure differential (related to speed) is established across the controller's main variable metering orifice (VMO).

A key design principle is that the VMO plunger sleeve rotates to enable smooth and precise movement of the VMO plunger and regulator sleeve under available power. Thus, the sliding surfaces are always in relative motion, minimizing friction and hysteresis.

Finally, when the throttle lever is set to the maximum position, the requirement for automatic engine control is achieved through several methods, none of which compromise the previously described principles. By reducing the final air pressure acting on the bellows to decrease the size of the main metering orifice (VMO), fuel flow is adjusted to limit the high-pressure compressor outlet pressure (\( P_3 \)). The method for limiting the maximum temperature of the high-pressure turbine or high-pressure compressor involves automatically reducing the "speed selection lever" setting on the CASC beyond the pilot-selected maximum throttle position, then adjusting fuel flow through the regulator in the normal manner.

## 5. CASC Design Notes

### 5.1 Generation of Acceleration Control Action

During acceleration, the regulator spring pushes the regulator sleeve against the acceleration stop pin, causing the VMO to operate at a constant gap width. Thus, the metering area depends on the width of the triangular port exposed by the gap. This, in turn, depends on the high-pressure and low-pressure compressor pressures acting on the vacuum bellows (see Appendices 14 and 15). As an example, consider the calibration proposed for the first CASC unit, shown in Appendix 2 (Section 15). This appendix also provides the basic engine operating line and the proposed acceleration and deceleration lines. From a geometric perspective, the appropriate bellows ratio \( \frac{64}{99} \) is 0.455, and the appropriate divider ratio "R" is 4.9. The pressure differential is determined by the force generated by the flyweights acting on the differential piston.

VMO pressure differential \( = K N_H^2 \) (see Figure 6 in Section 15)

Any imbalance between the pressure differential and the flyweight force is corrected by the pump servo mechanism, which adjusts the pump stroke to change the fuel flow until equilibrium is restored.

Combining the above data, under blocked divider orifice conditions:

\[
\frac{F}{P_2 N_H} = f \left( \frac{P_3}{P_2} \right) - 0.455
\]

At low engine speeds, if the venturi becomes subcritical, the acceleration characteristic curve changes its slope and continues to decline to zero.

In the Spey MK202, the CASC's VMO is divided into two parts. The first part is a triangular port located on the side controlled by the regulator gap width. The second part is a rectangular port moved by the bellows to provide a variable flow area. The rectangular port is not controlled by the regulator. Slots are preferable to circular holes because they provide a larger area for a given sleeve diameter.

### 5.2 Deceleration Control and Steady-State Operation

Deceleration control is achieved by moving the pilot's throttle lever (which moves the CASC speed selection lever via a cam box) to reduce the required engine speed. The regulator spring force is reduced, and the regulator moves in the direction of closing the VMO gap under the greater flyweight force. To prevent the gap from closing completely and causing flameout, this movement must be limited. The minimum VMO gap width thus obtained provides a deceleration control (DCU) that is a fixed proportion of the acceleration curve, positioned below the steady-state operating line, resulting in dimensionless deceleration control.

There exists a condition where the pilot's speed control lever is in a fixed position (engine idle position) but can produce a varying engine speed. In this case, the engine idle speed is required to increase with altitude to provide sufficient air for aircraft equipment and cabin pressurization and to allow rapid acceleration at any altitude. In the CASC system, this requirement is conveniently met by setting a small bypass hole in parallel with the VMO. The flow characteristic number of this hole is approximately 6.5 and can be adjusted via a needle valve, but it cannot be reduced further when set to the minimum flow area. When the throttle lever is pulled back to the minimum (idle) position, the resulting combined flow increases its influence with altitude. During aircraft climb, the engine fuel flow required to maintain a given speed becomes smaller, and as the engine speed gradually increases, the engine fuel demand curve intersects the modified deceleration control characteristic line, achieving an elevated idle speed. Only at low altitudes does the speed regulator control the engine idle speed to a sufficiently low level.

Under International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) sea-level static conditions, the throttle lever angle/thrust relationship is approximately linear. This requirement is met by designing an appropriate cam profile. The cam compresses the regulator spring within the CASC, thereby predetermining an appropriate fuel flow at the set speed.

Fuel density compensation is accomplished as described in Section 14.

The \( P_3 \) limiter operates via a bellows sensing \( P_3 \) (loaded with a spring).

When the \( P_3 \) limit value is reached, the bellows moves to open a throttle hole parallel to the venturi. This throttle hole is designed to be sufficiently large to counteract the effect of the speed regulator increasing the VMO gap width, thereby reducing the fuel flow to the engine.

Maximum temperature control (\( T_6 \) and \( T_3 \)) is achieved through an amplifier. Thermocouple signals (monitoring temperature signals) are fed to the amplifier. When \( T_6 \) or \( T_3 \) reaches the limit value, the signal from the amplifier is sent to a servo motor, which moves to change the lever ratio and reduce the regulator spring load. This adjusts the fuel flow and overrides the pilot's throttle lever input. The allowable maximum adjusted fuel flow is set to ensure that \( T_6 \) or \( T_3 \) does not exceed the specified maximum value. If this system fails, the fully adjusted fuel flow is still sufficient to prevent excessive thrust loss.

## 6. Estimation of Flight Idle Speed

| Spey MK202 Estimation of Flight Idle Speed |         |

# Abstract

This report provides the engine idle speeds across a range of altitudes and Mach numbers under cold-day, hot-day, and standard-day conditions.

With the current CASC unit adjustments and brochure-standard performance, to prevent overspeed during zoom climbs above specified altitudes, the engine must be shut down as shown in Figures 2 to 6. If such shutdowns are not permissible, the CASC unit can be recalibrated to operate at higher altitudes. However, this would reduce low-altitude idle speed and fuel flow, thereby increasing engine oil temperature, which is already at its limit under these conditions. Recent tests, however, indicate that the engine is more sensitive to Reynolds number effects than assumed in the brochure, which also reduces high-altitude idle speed. Thus, the flight envelope limitations are not as stringent as indicated in this report.

# Assumptions

1. Engine performance is based on the latest standard.
2. Idle regulator characteristic performance is estimated. Air divider characteristics.
3. Inlet pressure recovery coefficient as a function of inlet mass flow and Mach number—predicted performance.
4. Figure 1 shows the adopted atmospheric temperature standards: 1962 U.S. Standard Atmosphere, British Cold-Day and Hot-Day Standards, and the most severe weather standards of the UK and U.S.
5. The engine is designed to operate only momentarily when inlet temperature exceeds 395 K. This is indicated in the design (limited) flight envelope in Figures 7 to 9.

# Results

Figures 2 to 6 show engine idle speed curves plotted against altitude and Mach number within the design flight envelope using the atmospheric standards from Figure 1. Idle speeds for temperatures between cold-day and hot-day conditions are determined by interpolation.

The curves in these figures represent the maximum allowable \( N_H \) for the engine with \( T_6 \) limitation.

These figures also include curves for the maximum allowable \( N_H \) without \( T_3 \) limitation.

The approximate operating range of the \( \frac{N_H}{\sqrt{T_1}} \) limiter is also shown.

Figures 7 to 9 illustrate the impact of the above limitations on the design flight envelope under British Standard Cold-Day, Hot-Day, and 1962 U.S. Standard Atmosphere conditions.

# Discussion

To accommodate possible zoom climb conditions, the design flight envelope has been revised to 100,000 feet altitude. These flight envelopes are shown in Figures 7 to 9. With the current fuel system adjustments, some flight conditions at higher altitudes may result in idle speeds exceeding the maximum allowable value.

At these high-altitude flight conditions, the engine limiters do not function because the \( T_6 \) limiter and \( T_3 \) limiter (when present) operate via the \( \Delta N_H \) regulator, while the \( N_H \) regulator rests against the deceleration control stop pin. The engine \( P_3 \) pressure is below the \( P_3 \) limiter setting, and the \( N_L \) regulator adjustment does not interfere with other flight conditions. Under some extreme conditions, the \( \frac{N_H}{\sqrt{T_1}} \) limiter has some effect, but for flight safety, engine speed cannot be significantly reduced.

The fuel system can be recalibrated to ensure that idle speed remains below the maximum value at any flight condition. However, this would reduce idle speed at low altitudes. The lower idle speed and corresponding reduced fuel flow would cause the engine to heat the oil, leading to higher oil temperatures.

In Figures 7 to 9, areas are marked within the revised flight envelope where the engine cannot operate according to brochure performance requirements with the current fuel system settings.

Under standard-day conditions and \( M = 2.15 \), the engine is required to operate up to 72,000 feet altitude. This requirement is just met, as the \( T_6 \)-limited engine must be shut down above 72,000 feet under these conditions (see Figure 8).

Recent tests indicate that the engine is more sensitive to Reynolds number effects than assumed in the brochure. This effect reduces engine idle speed at high altitudes, making the flight envelope corresponding to more realistic performance less stringent.

![Image](images/75e0dae0f81bafbde1f928092e528c17c341d5ad0612a1953ae81463e83474d4.jpg)
**Figure 1 (Revision 2, 28 July 1965)**

#### Abstract
This report outlines the derivation of the recommended \(N_H \sim T_1\) control and nozzle temperature (\(T_6\)) control, which are included in the engine control system requirements. The \(T_6 \sim T_1\) requirements are directly derived from performance data.

#### \(N_H \sim T_1\) Requirements
The \(N_H \sim T_1\) control requirements proposed by the Performance Department require modification. In practice, generating such a curved control characteristic is difficult; therefore, a characteristic line composed of straight-line segments is proposed (see **Figure 1**). This linear characteristic is included in the fuel system requirements.

#### \(T_6 \sim T_1\) Control Requirements
The currently recommended nozzle temperature (\(T_6\)) limits are shown in **Figure 2**. It can be observed that the recommended baseline values for engine augmentation (afterburning) without Boundary Layer Control (BLC) and the readjusted \(T_6\) signal values satisfying engine requirements when BLC is used without augmentation are provided.

### 8. Relationship Between Net Thrust and Engine Control Input Angle

**Technical Design Report**

**Relationship Between Net Thrust and Engine Control Input Angle for the Spey MK202**

**Revision 5, 29 March 1966**

#### Abstract
**Figure 1** presents the relationship between thrust (expressed as a percentage of maximum non-afterburning net thrust) and engine control input angle under International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) sea-level static conditions, without afterburning or air bleed. The engine control input angle refers to the input angle to the cam box, linked via linkage to the pilot’s control lever.

**Figures 3 and 2** (not shown here) respectively present the relationship between net thrust percentage and engine control input angle for 7-stage and 12-stage HP compressor normal maximum bleed conditions.

#### Data Used
1. In the non-afterburning range, the relationship between HP shaft speed and the angle of the CASC (Combined Acceleration and Speed Control) unit is obtained from the latest Lucas CASC cam profile. Considering the variation of \(R_{01}\) with HP shaft speed, this relationship is converted into thrust versus CASC unit angle.
2. The relationship between engine mean thrust and the percentage of maximum afterburning fuel flow is derived from performance data.
3. The relationship between afterburning fuel flow and afterburner input lever position is assumed to be linear.
4. In the non-afterburning range, the maximum and minimum limits of nominal thrust due to CASC tolerances are provided by Lucas Gas Turbine Equipment Ltd.
5. The maximum and minimum limits of afterburning fuel flow due to afterburning fuel control unit tolerances are provided by Dowty Fuel Systems Ltd.
6. The limits of afterburning level due to afterburning fuel control unit tolerances are also provided by Dowty Fuel Systems Ltd.
7. In the non-afterburning range, for a given HP shaft speed, the engine mean thrust limit is \(\pm 2\%\). During afterburning, for a given fuel flow, the engine mean thrust limit is \(-4\%\).
8. The total tolerance in the connection between the fuel control unit and the engine input lever is \(\pm \frac{1}{2}^\circ\) in engine input lever angle.
9. The dimensionless mass flow functions for 7-stage and 12-stage bleed are:

# **Abstract**
This report presents a method for estimating the **idle speed** of an engine with current performance standards under any flight condition.

---

# **1. Introduction**
The method for estimating idle speed provided in this report is based on a general approach. The foundation involves:
1. **Guessing an idle speed** and calculating the **required fuel flow** from performance curves.
2. Estimating the **total fuel flow supplied by the control system** (main + primary nozzles).
3. If the supplied and required flows are unequal, **re-guessing the engine speed** until equilibrium is achieved.

Under certain flight conditions where fuel is supplied **only via the primary nozzle**, the estimated primary nozzle flow must be compared to the calculated total flow (main + primary). If the primary flow exceeds the total, the idle speed must be re-guessed until the **engine-required flow matches the primary nozzle flow**.

---

# **2. Method**

## **2.1 Required Performance Data**

### **(a) Engine Performance**
The following engine performance parameters are required (obtained from current engine performance data):

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{F_E}{\mu_{F_E} \alpha_E P_1 \sqrt{T_1}} \sim \frac{N_H}{\sqrt{T_1}} \\
& \frac{P_2}{\mu_{P_2} P_1} \sim \frac{N_H}{\sqrt{T_1}} \\
& \frac{P_3}{\mu_{P_3} P_1} \sim \frac{N_H}{\sqrt{T_1}} \\
& \mu_{F_E} \sim \frac{N_H}{\sqrt{T_1}} \\
& \mu_{P_2} \sim \frac{N_H}{\sqrt{T_1}} \\
& \mu_{P_3} \sim \frac{N_H}{\sqrt{T_1}} \\
& \alpha_E \sim \frac{F_E}{\omega_E \sqrt{T_1} P_1}
\end{aligned}
\]

### **(b) Fuel System Performance**
The following fuel system performance curves are required (provided in **Figure 1** and **Figure 2** of this report):

\[
\frac{P_{3P}}{P_2} \sim \frac{P_3}{P_2}
\]

\[
n_{VMO} \sim (P_{3P} - a \times P_2)
\]

---

## **2.3 Theory**

### **(1) Calculate Inlet Conditions**
\[
M_N = \frac{V_K}{38.953 \sqrt{t_0}}
\]

\[
P_1 = p_0 \times R_{01} \quad \text{psi (absolute)}
\]

### **(2) Guess an Idle Speed \( N_H \)**
Calculate \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \).

### **(3) Calculate Engine-Required Fuel Flow**
Using \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \) and \( T_1 \), determine:
- \( \mu_{F_E} \)
- \( \frac{F_E}{\mu_{F_E} \alpha_E P_1 \sqrt{T_1}} \)
- \( \mu_{F_E} \alpha_E \sqrt{T_1} \)
- \( HFE \)
- \( \alpha_E \)

Thus, compute \( F_E \) (lb/hr).

### **(4) Calculate Control System Fuel Flow**
Using \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \) and \( T_1 \), determine:
- \( P_2 \)
- \( P_3 \)

Since \( p_3 = 0.97 P_3 \), compute \( P_3 / P_2 \).

From **Figure 1**, determine \( P_{3P} / P_2 \), then compute \( P_{3P} \).

Compute \( (P_{3P} - a \times P_2) \).

From **Figure 2**, determine \( n_{VMO} \).

Using \( N_H \) and the equation:
\[
\Delta P_{VMO} = \left( \frac{N_H}{1264} \right)^2
\]
compute \( \Delta P_{VMO} \).

### **(5) Compare Fuel Flows**
If \( F \neq F_E \), re-guess \( N_H \) until \( F = F_E \).

### **(6) Check Primary Nozzle Flow**
Using the final \( N_H \) and \( n_{VMO} \), compute \( n_0 \):
\[
n_0 = \frac{n_{VMO} \times n_P}{\sqrt{(n_{VMO})^2 + (n_P)^2}}
\]

Thus:
\[
F' = \rho \sqrt{\Delta P_s} \quad \text{lb/hr}
\]

### **(7) Final Adjustment**
- If \( F > F' \), use the \( N_H \) from Step 5.
- If \( F < F' \), re-guess \( N_H \) until \( F' = F_E \). (No need to recalculate \( \Delta P_{VMO} \) or \( F \).)

# **3. Example Calculation**

## **3.1 Flight Conditions**
- **Altitude:** Sea level
- **Airspeed:** Static (0 knots)
- **Atmospheric Temperature:** ISA (\( t_0 = 288 \)°K)
- **Power Extraction:** None
- **Bleed Air:** None
- \( T_1 = t_0 = 288 \)°K
- Inlet total pressure recovery coefficient: \( \eta_{01} = 0.995 \)
- \( P_1 = p_0 \times 0.995 = 14.62 \) psi (absolute)

## **3.2 Guess \( N_H = 6500 \) RPM**
\[
\frac{N_H}{\sqrt{T_1}} = 383.5
\]

## **3.3 From Performance Data**
\[
\frac{F_E}{\mu_{F_E} \alpha_E P_1 \sqrt{T_1}} = 3.54

## Section 66 (Pages 326-330)

Here is the complete English translation of the provided Chinese technical document about the Spey MK202 aircraft engine:

---

\[
\mu_{g} = 1.0
\]

\[
\frac{F_E}{\alpha_E} = 3.54 \times 1.0 \times 14.62 \times \sqrt{288} = 877
\]

\[
\frac{\vec{F_E}'}{\boldsymbol{\alpha_E} \sqrt{\vec{P_1}}} = \frac{877}{\sqrt{14.62}} = 229
\]

From performance data, \(\alpha_z = 1.113\)

Thus, \(F_B = 978\) lb/hr

#### 3.4 From Performance Data

\[
\frac{P_2}{\mu_{\downarrow 2} P_1} = 1.05 \qquad \frac{P_3}{\mu_{\downarrow 3} P_1} = 2.795
\]

\[
\mu_{P_2} = 1.0
\]

\[
\mu_{\rho_3} = 1.0
\]

\[
P_3 / P_2 = 2.453
\]

From Figure 1, \(P_{3P} / P_2 = 1.018\)

\(P_{3P} - aP_2 = 16.46 - 0.455 \times 16.18 = 9.11\) psi

From Figure 2, \(n_{VMO} = 24\)

\[
\Delta P_{VMO} = \frac{6500^2}{1264^2} = 26.45
\]

Thus,

\[
F = \rho n_{VMO} \sqrt{\Delta P_{VMO}} = 7.9 \times 24 \times \sqrt{26.45} = 978 \text{ lb/hr}
\]

3.5 \(F\) and \(F_E\) are consistent, so the assumed \(N_H = 6500\) rpm is correct.

3.6

\[
n_0 = \frac{24 \times 2.5}{\sqrt{24^2 + 2.5^2}} = 2.48
\]

\[
F' = \rho n_0 \sqrt{\Delta P_s} = 7.9 \times 2.48 \times \sqrt{305} = 342
\]

3.7 Since \(F > F'\), the idle speed \(N_H = 6500\) rpm is confirmed.

### 10. Drift of the High-Pressure Rotational Speed Regulator

| Technical Design Report | TDR4181 |
|-------------------------|---------|
| Drift of the High-Pressure Rotational Speed Regulator of the Spey MK202 under Various Flight Conditions |

Lucas Gas Turbine Equipment Limited provided the following data on the drift of the high-pressure regulator under International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) conditions at 36,089 feet, Mach 1.2 (\(T_1 = 280 \, \text{K}\)) and Mach 2.2 (\(T_1 = 426 \, \text{K}\)). This data is based on the operation of Engine No. 37 in the altitude test facility and the CASC calibration of the first seven flight engines with low working lines. It is assumed that the maximum regulated speed at sea level static conditions is 12,640 rpm.

- ISA, 36,089 feet, Mach 1.2, maximum \(N_H = 12,300\) rpm.
- ISA, 36,089 feet, Mach 2.2, maximum \(N_H = 13,100\) rpm.

The latter result is based on performance extrapolation and extended fuel system calibration, and even the most effective estimates can only be considered approximate.

To reduce drift, subsequent CASC units incorporate modifications (modification of the \(N^2\) term).

### 11. Estimation of Idle Conditions for First Flight Engines

|-------------------------|---------|
| Estimation of Idle Conditions for Spey MK202 First Flight Engines |

# Abstract

This report provides the actual high-pressure shaft idle speeds for early flight engines delivered to customers at selected flight conditions.

As seen from the results in Table 1, the high-pressure shaft idle speeds are lower than those predicted in TDR796 and have been proven satisfactory in flight tests, as the 4th edition (in TDR796) used generic characteristics.

# Introduction

The requirement for idle speed to increase with altitude in the "Phantom" aircraft is achieved by bypassing the regulator in the control system. This report examines selected flight conditions to verify whether the idle speeds of early flight engines exceed the maximum allowable engine rated speed.

Data from the altitude test chamber and test bench of the flight standard engine, as well as the latest CASC calibration results for flight engines, were used.

## Data Utilized

(a) Average performance data from the test bench of flight engines, sourced from unpublished performance room data.

(b) Altitude coefficients of test bench performance.

(c) \(T_1\) correction factors.

(d) Engine fuel flow correction factors.

(e) Standard atmospheric temperature.

(f) CASC idle speed calibration.

(g) Air pressure divider value of 4.6.

## Results

The idle conditions at selected flight test points are presented below.

# Discussion

Idle speeds are lower than those predicted in earlier reports using brochure performance (compare columns 3 and 4 in Table 1). Within the altitude range of 75,000 feet, idle speeds did not exceed the maximum allowable speed; altitudes above 75,000 feet were not studied.

Accurate data is difficult to obtain when the flight engine operates at low non-dimensional speeds (i.e., with bleed valves open).

The calculated idle speeds for conditions (e) and (f) are close to ground idle speeds (possibly due to incorrect ram ratio conversion). These results are inconsistent with previous idle speed tests and are therefore disregarded.

For the oil system, the limiting flight conditions are at 45,000 feet on a hot day and Mach 1.0.

From the studied conditions, the \(T_3\) limit of 806 °K was not exceeded.

### 12. Hysteresis of the Cam Box Input Lever

**1st Edition, 9 November 1966**

| Technical Design Report | TDR7005 |
|-------------------------|---------|
| Hysteresis of the Cam Box Input Lever of the Spey MK202 |

### 1. Purpose of the Report

To summarize the existing hysteresis data of the power control system. The aircraft manufacturer requires a hysteresis band of 1°.

### 2. Conclusions

2.1 The evidence available to date indicates that the current engine system limits the hysteresis of the cam box input angle to 1°, which is a practical requirement for the following usage: power lever movements within the landing approach power range (approximately 80% - 90% \(N_H\), 12-stage boundary layer control) only require small adjustments around the steady-state thrust condition.

2.2 For power lever movements from idle to takeoff and from takeoff to idle, the above requirement is less practical. Tests conducted so far show that one of the two test engines exceeded the requirement for maximum hysteresis.

Further testing is needed to empirically establish the requirement in Section 2.1 for some engines. Special attention should be given to eliminating backlash in the test instruments and reducing throttle lever friction to enable very small throttle lever movements (less than 0.1°).

Testing should be conducted by making small changes in throttle lever angle near steady thrust states, rather than by pushing from idle to takeoff thrust and pulling back to idle.

## 3. Introduction

3.1 The aircraft manufacturer's requirement specifies a hysteresis limit of 1° for the cam box input lever.

3.2 This report documents and evaluates the data obtained so far from engine and test bench tests regarding this requirement.

### 4. Test Bench Testing of CASC Units

4.1 Lucas's relevant reports document the hysteresis values of the input levers for three CASC units, with a maximum hysteresis of 30 minutes.

4.2 After setting a suitable combination of regulator flow and input lever angle, the hysteresis is determined by opening and closing the input lever to move away from and return to the set flow. The hysteresis is the difference between the two input lever angles corresponding to a small deviation from the set flow and returning to it. The results of these tests are shown in Table 1.

## 5. Engine Testing

### 5.1
From testing on Engine No. 503, the relationship between engine speed and cambox input angle during speed increase and decrease was obtained. **Figure 1** shows the resulting hysteresis curve.

### 5.2
Under conditions where test instrumentation was applied to the cambox input lever and CASC device, similar tests were conducted on Engine No. 39. The engine was operated at four thrust levels by increasing the input lever setting, then operated at the same thrust levels by decreasing the input lever setting. The test results are plotted in **Figure 2**.

### 5.3
To determine hysteresis for small deviations near steady thrust conditions, further testing was conducted on Engine No. 39. This test involved several steady thrust conditions, each achieved by moving the throttle lever in a predetermined direction with a small final movement. After the engine stabilized, the throttle lever was moved away from the steady setting in the opposite direction of the final movement, and the movement required to produce a perceptible change in thrust from the steady state was recorded.

---

## 6. Results

### 6.1
Lucas test rig tests indicated that the maximum hysteresis in the CASC angle was 30 minutes. The ratio between the cambox input lever and CASC lever is very close to 1; therefore, a 30-minute hysteresis in the CASC approximately results in a 30-minute hysteresis in engine input.

### 6.2
**Figure 1** shows that the maximum hysteresis in cambox input angle recorded on Engine No. 503 is approximately **1.2°**. Ignoring linkage growth and backlash, the CASC hysteresis is approximately equal to **1.2°**.

### 6.3
The curves for Engine No. 39 (**Figure 2**) show a maximum cambox input hysteresis of **1°** and a maximum CASC input hysteresis of **0.75°**. However, these results cannot be readily accepted because the CASC input quantity curve is reversible at high speeds, indicating some backlash in the CASC display system. Thus, the maximum CASC input hysteresis may be slightly larger than the indicated results.

### 6.4
Results from the "small movement" hysteresis test on Engine No. 39 are tabulated below:

**(a)** If a steady thrust is achieved by moving the throttle lever in the increasing thrust direction, the minimum throttle lever displacement that produces a perceptible thrust decrease is the hysteresis.

| 90.04        | 8450         | 49.9          | 56     | 5.65          | 33.8   | 50.0          | 55.9   | 5.7           | 33.1   | 0.1        | 0.7        |

**(b)** If a steady thrust is achieved by moving the throttle lever in the decreasing thrust direction, the minimum throttle lever displacement that produces a thrust increase is the hysteresis.

| 79.99        | 2420         | 63.9          | 35.1   | 7.6           | 13.8   | 63.2          | 36     | 7.53          | 14.4   | 0.9        | 0.6        |
| 90.00        | 8470         | 50.0          | 55.9   | 5.65          | 33.8   | 49.7          | 56.3   | 5.63          | 34     | 0.4        | 0.2        |

It should be noted that the above results show some inconsistencies in the apparent relationship between cambox input and CASC input. In section (a), at 2420 lbf thrust, the cambox and CASC hysteresis are the same, but at 8450 lbf thrust, they differ significantly. For the following reasons, these results are considered only approximate for the real situation:

1. As mentioned in section 6.3, the backlash in the test instrumentation, purely due to mechanical effects, results in greater control hysteresis. It is known that there is measurable backlash in the connecting rods and crank system of the CASC input lever test instrumentation.

2. Due to inherent stiffness factors in the test rig control lever, it is not always possible to measure the minimum movement required to change thrust. In most cases, the quoted results represent the minimum movement obtainable on the throttle lever. The actual hysteresis may be slightly smaller than indicated by the test.

---

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1
It has been noted that the test procedures described in sections 5.1 and 5.2 are not entirely suitable for determining hysteresis limits. The system is more likely to be disturbed by small throttle lever movements at steady thrust, which may have a greater impact than the overall effect of increasing power lever settings from a "cold" state and decreasing power lever settings from a "hot" state. From the results of Engine No. 39 testing (section 5.2, **Figure 2**), it is evident that engine performance changes when operated in this manner. The speed required to achieve a given thrust by decreasing power is lower than that required to achieve the same thrust by increasing power.

### 7.2
It can be expected that the hysteresis for small cambox input lever movements at steady thrust would be smaller than that measured in the above tests. However, the "small movement" test results (section 6.4) do not clearly demonstrate this. Although there are indications that within the approach power range, cambox input hysteresis is within the required **1°** limit, further testing is recommended. Special attention should be given to reducing the influence of throttle lever stiffness and estimating the backlash in the test instrumentation.

### **Technical Design Report TDR 7799**
### **Spey MK202: Estimation of Maximum High-Pressure Compressor Outlet Pressure Due to P₃ Limiter Failure**

#### **1. Purpose**
To estimate the maximum high-pressure compressor outlet static pressure (p₃) resulting from P₃ limiter failure.

#### **2. Conclusions**
2.1 **P₃ limiter failure not caused by capsule fault** allows P₃ to reach approximately **533 psia**. The normal maximum p₃ is **345 psia**.

2.2 **P₃ limiter capsule failure** causes additional airflow, increasing pressure loss in the p₃ air line to the CASC. Thus, the controlled p₃ depends on the size of the hole leaking air from the capsule to the atmosphere. For a **3/16-inch diameter hole** in the capsule, the controlled p₃ rises to approximately **390 psia**. Further increases in hole size will reduce engine power and p₃, depending on the size of the leak.

2.3 Thus, if the **P₃ limiter capsule is damaged**, engine power at sea-level takeoff conditions will be reduced. The degree of power reduction depends on the severity of the capsule leak.

#### **4. Introduction**
This report assesses the potential impact of **P₃ limiter failure** on the maximum p₃ value for:
- (a) Failures without additional air leakage to the atmosphere (i.e., non-capsule faults).
- (b) Failures caused by **P₃ limiter capsule damage**.

#### **5. Assumptions**
5.1 The highest p₃ may occur at **1.209 MN**, cold weather (**T₁ = 319.5 K**), considering aircraft flight and temperature envelopes.

5.2 Engine non-dimensional performance with afterburner is provided by the Performance Department.

5.3 The **P₃ limiter** functions normally when the pressure in the bellows can still establish normal working pressure. This is because the effect of leaks or cracks reducing internal bellows force is small compared to the force generated by gas pressure acting on the effective bellows area.

5.4 The flow coefficient of the leak hole in the capsule is taken as **0.7**. The loss through the hole is assumed to be one dynamic head.

5.5 The air temperature drop through the **Fuel-Cooled Air Cooler (FCAC)** is assumed constant at **180°C**. The air temperature varies with speed as:
\[
T_{3\text{ air}} = T_{3} - 180 \text{ K}
\]

5.6 Half of the pressure head loss is assumed to be due to air exiting a **0.32-inch diameter hole** into the capsule (effective capsule area = **π/4 × 0.625² ≈ 0.307 in²**).

5.7 The conduit area from the FCAC to CASC and the internal hole area in the limiter housing = **0.0804 in²**.

5.8 Acceleration control is calculated by applying steady **P₃** and **P₂** pressures to a typical CASC calibration. Transient effects of **P₁** and **P₂** are ignored.

5.9 When calculating conduit pressure loss, the flow through the divider is increased by the leakage amount.

5.10 The pressure loss in the hole of the **P₃ limiter** is assumed to be small and is ignored. Most of the pressure loss due to leakage is caused by the short pipe from the FCAC to CASC. For a **16-inch long conduit**, the pressure head loss due to bends is **3.5**.

5.11 Additional pressure drop upstream of the FCAC due to additional flow is ignored. Since the upstream conduit inner diameter is much larger than **5/16 inch** and carries afterburner servo airflow, the increase in CASC airflow is unlikely to cause a significant increase in conduit pressure drop.

5.12 The **high-pressure compressor outlet total pressure (P₃)** is **1.069 times** the CASC pipeline pressure just downstream of the FCAC, and **p₃ = 0.97 P₃**.

The **low-pressure compressor outlet pressure (P₂)** = **1.025 P₂ (ROD)**.

5.13 When calculating the maximum speed of the high-pressure regulator, it is assumed that under **International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) sea-level static conditions**, the nominal setting of the high-pressure regulator is **98.5% Nₕ**.

5.14 The normal setting range of the **F/Nₕ limiter** is **1.125 to 1.24**. When considering this limiter in operation, the minimum setting is assumed to be **1.125**.

### 5.15 Cooling and Servo Flow from High-Pressure Fuel System
The average values of cooling flow and servo flow from the high-pressure fuel system are assumed based on the use of AVTAG fuel. Together, they define the possible fuel supply capacity of the high-pressure fuel pump under extreme failure conditions to limit fuel flow.

# 6. Results

### 6.1
At **M<sub>N</sub> = 1.209** and under cold-day conditions, if the **P<sub>3</sub>** limiter fails, the expected maximum **p<sub>3</sub>** values are as follows:

(1) When the **N<sub>H</sub>** governor takes control:
**p<sub>3</sub> = 531 psi (absolute)**, low-pressure compressor outlet total pressure **(P<sub>2</sub>) = 86.5 psi (absolute)**.

(2) When the **F/N<sub>H</sub>** limiter takes control, with **N(F/N<sub>H</sub>) = 1.125** (minimum setting), **N<sub>H</sub> = 94.7%**, **p<sub>3</sub> = 489 psi (absolute)**.

(3) When limited by pump capacity, **N<sub>H</sub> = 95.5%**, **p<sub>3</sub> = 509 psi (absolute)**. Additionally, when the pump relief valve is open, accurately predicting the maximum **p<sub>3</sub>** value is difficult.

The above data pertain to **P<sub>3</sub>** limiter failures **not** caused by **P<sub>3</sub>** capsule leakage.

### 6.2
If the **P<sub>3</sub>** limiter capsule is damaged with a hole diameter of approximately **3/16 inch**, the estimated maximum **p<sub>3</sub> = 390 psi (absolute)** (**P<sub>2</sub> = 72.5 psi (absolute)**).

For a **3/16-inch** diameter hole, as the capsule leakage increases, the maximum **p<sub>3</sub>** value rises from **345 psi (absolute)** (no leakage) to **390 psi (absolute)**. If the hole size exceeds this value, the acceleration line will fall below the steady-state operating line, significantly reducing engine power depending on the leakage level (see **Figure 1**).

### 6.3
Similarly, the acceleration line was plotted for a typical takeoff condition (ISA sea level, **M<sub>N</sub> = 0.3**) with a **P<sub>3</sub>** limiter capsule hole diameter of **1/4 inch**. It shows that the engine speed is controlled at **95% N<sub>H</sub>**. Any increase in leakage will further reduce engine power.

# 7. Discussion

### 7.1
**P<sub>3</sub>** limiter failures not caused by capsule damage are relatively rare but can result from:
(a) Control rod jamming, or
(b) External adjustment screws causing the hemispherical valve to close completely.

### 7.2
The results in **Section 6.1** indicate that if the bellows reverse stop screw is set to the minimum limit, the engine can be limited by either the **F/N<sub>H</sub>** limiter or the high-pressure shaft speed governor. The engine may also be limited by the high-pressure fuel pump flow capacity before the high-pressure speed governor takes control.

Since the **P<sub>3</sub>** limit depends on both the limiter’s set value and the high-pressure fuel pump and its associated leakage, the limiting value is difficult to determine precisely. However, **p<sub>3</sub>** cannot exceed **531 psi (absolute)** under any circumstances.

### 7.3
Discussions with the **BFA (Stress Division)** revealed that the high-pressure compressor casing was tested at **1× normal operating pressure**, so it can withstand additional pressure for short durations. The likelihood of failure occurring first in extremely cold weather or high-speed flight is minimal.

### 7.4
Since the pressure drop occurs in the pipeline supplying **P<sub>3</sub>** to the **CASC**, the high-pressure rise caused by **P<sub>3</sub>** limiter capsule damage can be automatically moderated. The possibility of operating at increased maximum pressure over time cannot be ruled out. However, leakage can significantly reduce the **ACU** margin, warranting further investigation.

### 7.5
Sufficient leakage causes the acceleration line to fall below the engine operating line, leading to a substantial reduction in engine power. This significantly decreases sea-level takeoff thrust. This conclusion is based on trend analysis of computational results.

### 7.6
If the compressor outlet pressure is deemed too high, reducing the **F/N<sub>H</sub>** limiter setting to **0.89–0.91** can lower the outlet pressure. Under sea-level, cold-day conditions at **M<sub>N</sub> = 1.209**, this adjustment limits **P<sub>3</sub>** to approximately **396 psi (absolute)**. Preliminary checks indicate that this is unlikely to significantly interfere with engine acceleration.

### 7.7
If the potential issue becomes a real problem, adjusting the **F/N<sub>H</sub>** limiter, along with incorporating a suitable small restrictor in the **P<sub>3</sub>** limiter capsule passage, can serve as a safety measure to prevent significant engine power loss due to capsule failure.

### **Appendix 1: CASC System Theory**

By using a **dimensionless plot** of **reduced fuel flow (F / (P<sub>1</sub>√T<sub>1</sub>))** against **reduced speed (N / √T<sub>1</sub>)**, the complex steady-state engine performance across varying inlet conditions is simplified into a single curve. Similarly, a second unique curve representing the **engine stall boundary** can be plotted on the same graph. If acceleration control operates just below the stall boundary, the engine achieves the **maximum allowable excess fuel flow** for the fastest possible acceleration.

For the **Spey engine**, the critical stall condition occurs in the **high-pressure compressor**. The **high-pressure compressor, combustion chamber, and high-pressure turbine** can be treated as a complete engine, with its inlet conditions defined by the **low-pressure compressor outlet (P<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>)**. The appropriate dimensionless plot for the **Spey stall boundary** is:

\[
\left( \frac{F}{P_2 \sqrt{T_2}} \sim \frac{N_H}{\sqrt{T_2}} \right)
\]

However, measuring compressor temperature introduces difficulties. This can be eliminated by rearranging the dimensionless terms, using **pressure ratio (P<sub>3</sub>/P<sub>2</sub>)** instead of **N<sub>H</sub>/√T<sub>2</sub>**. This yields a new dimensionless parameter:

\[
\left( \frac{F}{P_2 N_H} \sim \frac{P_3}{P_2} \right)
\]

This forms the basis of the **CASC (Combined Acceleration and Speed Control)** system. High-quality acceleration control is achieved by eliminating explicit temperature terms while retaining implicit temperature compensation.

#### **Derivation of the Acceleration Control Function**
The foundation of any fuel system is the control of the **Variable Metering Orifice (VMO)** area (**A**) and its pressure differential (**ΔP**). Assuming the fluid loses its dynamic head through the orifice, the mass flow rate equation is:

\[
F = K A \sqrt{\Delta P}
\]

where **K** accounts for unit conversion and flow coefficients.

The **CASC** adjusts **A** and **ΔP** to provide the required acceleration/deceleration schedule and steady-state operation while automatically compensating for fuel type and temperature variations.

The metering area **A** is directly modified by selected engine pressures:

\[
A = f(P_3) - a P_2
\]

The pressure differential is determined by the force generated by flyweights acting on the differential piston.

For acceleration, combining these parameters using the **square-law flow equation** and rearranging gives:

\[
\frac{F}{P_2 N_H} = f \left( \frac{P_3}{P_2} - a \right)
\]

This achieves the desired dimensionless parameter combination. The exact shape of the characteristic curve depends on the compressor pressure function supplied to the controller.

#### **Bellows Assembly Displacement**
The displacement of the bellows assembly is proportional to:

\[
[P_{3P} R_1 + (P_{3P} - P_2) R_2]
\]

where:
- **R<sub>1</sub>** = stiffness of the evacuated bellows
- **R<sub>2</sub>** = stiffness of the **P<sub>2</sub>**-pressurized bellows
- **P<sub>3P</sub>** = partial pressure between **P<sub>3</sub>** and **P<sub>2</sub>**

Thus, the displacement is:

\[
\propto P_{3P} (R_1 + R_2) - R_2 P_2
\]

Assuming constant bellows stiffness, the **partial pressure (P<sub>3P</sub>)** is obtained from an **air pressure divider** (restrictor system).

When the venturi is **choked** (i.e., **m√T / (A<sub>2</sub>P<sub>3P</sub>) = 0.3964 = Q<sub>2</sub>**), the pressure ratio **P<sub>3</sub>/P<sub>3P</sub>** is determined by the area ratio **A<sub>2</sub>/A<sub>1</sub>**:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_{3P}} = \frac{A_2}{A_1} = R
\]

where **A** = effective area = **flow coefficient (C<sub>D</sub>) × geometric area**.

#### **Deceleration Control**
When the pilot reduces the selected engine speed, the **VMO area** is scaled down proportionally from the acceleration area, producing a **dimensionless deceleration control** below the steady-state line.

#### **Fuel Density Compensation**
The system’s acceleration/deceleration characteristics should be independent of fuel density to maintain accurate fuel mass flow. Since **VMO-metered fuel mass flow** is proportional to **√(fuel density)** at constant **ΔP**, the pressure differential must vary inversely with fuel density. This is achieved by selecting flyweight materials whose **apparent density** changes inversely with fuel density.

#### **Full-Range Speed Governing**
The **Spey engine** uses **full-range speed governing** to provide consistent thrust response across all altitudes, ensuring uniform "throttle feel" without excessive deadband. The **CASC** system integrates acceleration control and speed governing using the same metering orifice.

The **steady-state fuel requirement line** is nearly linear in the high-pressure ratio range, intersecting the acceleration control line at a point on the **P<sub>3</sub>/P<sub>2</sub>** axis. By adjusting the **VMO slot width**, both lines can be derived from the same controller.

---

### **Appendix 2: Initial CASC Calculation Example**

#### **Acceleration Control Curve**
\[
\frac{F}{P_2 N_H} = f \left( \frac{P_3}{P_2} - a \right)
\]

Assuming a **constant VMO slot width** and a **choked pressure divider system (P = R)**, the engine operates at:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_{3P}} = R
\]

where **P<sub>3P</sub>** is determined by the area ratio **A<sub>2</sub>/A<sub>1</sub>**.

---

### **Key Equations (Preserved in LaTeX)**

   \[
   Q_1 = \frac{m_1 \sqrt{T}}{A_1 P_3} = 0.3964
   \]
2. **Metering area:**
   \[
   A = f(P_3) - a P_2
   \]

   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_{3P}} = \frac{A_2}{A_1}

Here is the complete English translation of the provided Chinese technical document about the Spey MK202 aircraft engine, preserving all technical details, equations, and structure:

### High Pressure Ratio

\[
\frac{F}{P_2 N_H} = K_A \left( \frac{\partial p_3}{\partial P_2 : R} - a \right)
\]

The line representing acceleration control (ACU) and the line representing steady-state fuel requirement intersect on the \(P_3 / P_2\) axis, with the intersection coordinates as follows:

Substituting these values into Equation (2):

\[
0 = K_A \left( \frac{2.23}{R} - a \right)
\]

This yields:

\[
a = \frac{2.23}{R}
\]

At point A on the ACU, the coordinates are (6, 0.016).

From Equation (2):

\[
0.016 = K_A \left( \frac{6}{R} - a \right) = K_A \left( \frac{6}{R} - \frac{2.23}{R} \right)
\]

Thus:

\[
K_A = \frac{0.016 R}{3.77}
\]

When

\[
\frac{p_3}{P_2} = 1 \dagger, \quad \frac{F}{P_2 N_H} = 0.0114
\]

*(Translator’s note: The original text incorrectly states 0.0014.)*

Substituting into Equation (2):

\[
0.0114^* = \frac{0.016 R}{3.77} \left( 1 - \frac{2.23}{R} \right)
\]

From this, we derive:

\[
R = 4.91 \quad \text{and} \quad a = \frac{2.23}{R} = 0.455
\]

Thus, the appropriate area ratio for the air pressure divider system is \(\frac{A_2}{A_1} = 4.91\).

Next, considering appropriate flow coefficients, the sizes of the pressure divider throttle orifice and venturi are selected. To achieve a bellows ratio \(a = 0.455\), a total of 11 bellows is suitable, with 5 connected to \(P_2\).

---

### 2.2 Operation of the **T₆** Limiter on the Engine

The **T₆** limiter prevents **T₆** from exceeding a specified maximum value. The **T₆** limiter signal is derived from **T₆** thermocouples (located in the engine exhaust section, consisting of 8 parallel nickel-chromium/nickel-cobalt single-probe thermocouples).

This signal is compared against a standard voltage within the amplifier. If the **T₆** signal exceeds the standard voltage, the resulting error is amplified to drive the **CASC T₆** adjustment control rack toward the maximum adjustment stop (reducing **N_H**). The drive current remains on the motor control phase, causing continuous motor rotation until **T₆** equals the standard voltage, at which point the error disappears, the control current drops to zero, and the motor stops, bringing the system into equilibrium. Any further attempt to increase **T₆** results in additional adjustment. Since the system is a "zero-balance" stepless adjustment type, the temperature remains at a fixed value regardless of adjustment magnitude until the maximum adjustment stop is reached.

Due to the slow response of the **CASC T₆** control action, a phase-lead circuit must be introduced. This circuit directly applies maximum motor rotation voltage when the **T₆** rate of increase or decrease exceeds **70–100°C/sec**.

Unlike **T₃** control, which has a single maximum value, the **T₆/T₁** control characteristic has a defined shape to meet engine requirements. Additionally, when the engine operates with boundary layer control (BLC), the **T₆/T₄** relationship changes, requiring re-adjustment of the **T₆** control reference value. When air flows through the BLC sensing device to the **CASC** system to re-adjust the acceleration control unit (ACU), the BLC pressure switch contacts close. Closing the switch contacts activates the re-adjustment circuit, resetting the system to the **7-stage BLC** value. If the **12-stage BLC** coil is energized, the reference value shifts from the **7-stage** to the **12-stage** value.

**Figure 1** schematically represents the basic system and the **T₆/T₁** relationship.

## **T₃ and T₆ Adjustment Mechanism**

**Figure 2** illustrates the actual structure of the **T₆** adjustment device in the **CASC**. When **T₆** exceeds the reference value, the regulator spring load decreases, thereby reducing the regulated speed. As shown in the figure, the adjustment device consists of a lever **"A"** acted upon by the regulator spring, a speed selection lever cam, a **T₆**-operated roller, and a rack mechanism. The roller slides along a fixed track in a plane perpendicular to the regulator spring axis. When the speed selection lever cam is at a sufficiently high lift, the main lever **"B"** imparts an inclination to the temperature adjustment roller, forcing the main lever to rotate around the speed selection lever cam, thereby increasing or decreasing the regulator spring setting. When the speed selection lever cam lift is reduced, the effect of the adjustment roller **"C"** diminishes until, at minimum lift, lever **"B"** becomes parallel to the fixed track, eliminating all adjustment.

Two stop screws limit the travel of the "sector gear," thereby controlling the "unadjusted" and "maximum adjustment" values. The motor driving the **CASC T₆** control rack is an **18-inch** two-phase AC motor (international standard size), co-housed with a **15-inch** generator. The generator produces an output proportional to speed, providing a damping signal to ensure control loop stability. When the maximum **T₆** error signal is applied to the amplifier, the **CASC T₆** rack moves from "unadjusted" to "maximum adjustment" in **4.5–6.0 seconds**.

## 3. Low-Pressure Shaft Limiter

### 3.1 Initial Technical Requirements

#### 3.1.1 Technical Requirements Specification

The low-pressure shaft speed limiter regulates engine fuel flow to limit the low-pressure shaft speed to a specified value. This limiter operates independently of the **CASC** and is provided as a safety backup, meaning it should not limit the engine under any normal flight conditions.

#### 3.1.2 Engine Description

This engine is a twin-spool turbofan designed as a military aircraft powerplant. It is installed horizontally and features an afterburner system and a variable-geometry nozzle.

#### 3.1.3 Low-Pressure Shaft Limiter Characteristic Requirements

The low-pressure shaft limiter characteristics are defined as follows:

- The controller adjustment point is set at **9,000 rpm** low-pressure shaft speed, supplying **9,000 lb/hr** fuel flow.
- The required and maximum flow rate change on the characteristic line is **2.225 gallons/hour per low-pressure shaft rpm**.
- The characteristic shall be smoothly adjustable within **±1,000 rpm (low-pressure shaft speed)** relative to the given characteristic while maintaining the same controller flow rate change.

#### 3.1.4 Control Accuracy

For any fuel specified in **Section 3.1.11**, when the fuel temperature is between **0°C and 85°C**, the controller shall maintain low-pressure shaft speed within **±60 rpm**. When the fuel temperature drops to **-40°C** or rises to **+135°C**, the control accuracy shall remain within **±0.8%**.

### 3. Low-Pressure (LP) Shaft Speed Controller

At this time, the accuracy may be reduced to ±100 rpm (low-pressure shaft speed).

![Figure 2](images/208ca75405f551c2b879117e47cda4def6edb045e5187ae643399f2cd7afaa5a.jpg)
**Figure 2: Schematic Diagram of Spey MK202 CASC Temperature Control Mechanism**

#### 3.1.5 Resetting
This controller must have the capability to be reset within a range of 1000 rpm (low-pressure shaft speed) below normal values without affecting other devices, to allow adjustment of the limiter on the engine under sea-level cold-day conditions. Canceling this reset shall restore the fuel flow ~ low-pressure shaft speed characteristic given in Section 3.1.3, with accuracy within the range specified in Section 3.1.4.

#### 3.1.6 Flow Characteristic Number
The minimum allowable flow characteristic number for the uncontrolled low-pressure shaft limiter is **240** (fuel specific gravity = 0.79).

#### 3.1.7 Maximum Overshoot
When other engine limiters fail and control is assumed by the low-pressure shaft controller, the maximum overshoot of the high-pressure shaft speed shall not exceed **1.5%** of the maximum high-pressure shaft speed.

#### 3.1.8 Drive Ratio
The low-pressure shaft speed controller is driven by the engine’s low-pressure rotor at a speed of **0.4608 × low-pressure shaft speed**.

#### 3.1.9 Maximum Fuel Pressure
The maximum fuel pressure for this controller is **1930 psi (gauge pressure)**.

#### 3.1.10 Filtration
A low-pressure fuel filter is installed upstream of the low-pressure shaft controller. This filter shall have the following characteristics:
- (i) Filter out at least **95%** of all **10-micron** particles.
- (ii) The maximum particle size passing through the filter shall not exceed **40 microns**.

#### 3.1.11 Fuel
This device shall be designed to operate with any of the following fuels:

| AVTUR | AVTAG | AVCAT | JP1 | JP4 |
|-------|-------|-------|-----|-----|

Fuel may or may not contain **0.1–0.15% (by volume)** anti-icing additive.
Fuel temperature at the accessory inlet shall range from **-40°C to +135°C**.

#### 3.1.12 Fuel Contamination
This device shall be designed to operate without failure when using fuels specified in Section 3.1.11 that are contaminated in accordance with relevant British Ministry specifications. Endurance testing shall comply with standards agreed upon by Rolls-Royce and the customer for specific applications.
The device may also be internally contaminated by **saltwater (seawater)**.

---

### 3.2 Supplementary Design Requirements
The low-pressure shaft controller is entirely independent of the **CASC (Combined Acceleration and Speed Control)** and can override the fuel flow set by the CASC. In the event of a CASC malfunction causing excessive fuel flow to the fuel nozzles, the low-pressure shaft controller can prevent engine overspeed. In operation, low-pressure shaft speed is not normally a regulated parameter; the low-pressure shaft controller primarily serves as a **safety controller**.

Since the low-pressure shaft controller does not control the engine under all normal test-bed conditions, a resetting device is required to enable it to take control for calibration purposes.

---

### 3.3 Description of Operation and Design Features
This device essentially consists of a **centrifugal governor, metering plunger, balance spring, and reference reset mechanism**.

The **centrifugal governor** comprises a support driven by a shaft extended from the low-speed gearbox. The support holds flyweights mounted on pins, with each flyweight’s arm pressing against the end face of the metering plunger. This assembly is enclosed to prevent disturbance of the fuel around the flyweights.

The **metering plunger** is driven by a splined shaft extending from the centrifugal governor and rotates within a sleeve containing metering and outlet ports. One end of the plunger presses against a **three-lobe support**, which also forms the balance spring seat. This assembly is designed to allow axial movement of the metering plunger without any lateral loads from the drive or balance spring.

Between the metering plunger and the three-lobe support is a **buffer piston** surrounded by low-pressure fuel, which dampens pulsations of the metering plunger.

The **reference reset mechanism** consists of a piston with a calibration screw, a spring-loaded locking sleeve, and a locator. This device allows reduction of spring load using a specialized reset tool, enabling correct adjustment of the low-pressure shaft controller during sea-level test-bed testing.

The low-pressure shaft controller does not control the **secondary fuel circuit flow**. As altitude increases, the secondary circuit flow changes relatively little compared to the total fuel flow, while the portion of total fuel flow controlled by the low-pressure shaft controller decreases with altitude. Due to the inherent non-isochronous control nature of this simple flyweight-type controller, the controlled low-pressure shaft speed is permitted to drift upward with increasing altitude.

Another constraint on the low-pressure shaft controller’s control characteristics is that the entire system must remain stable when the controller is in control. Increasing the gain of the low-pressure shaft controller can reduce drift, but any improvement in drift is always at the expense of reduced stability margin.

The control characteristics of the low-pressure shaft controller are shown in **Figure 3**.

![Figure 3](images/a98cc93e10574f94b1a128c10f1802700e45d74132970f3595b435111971325b.jpg)

### 4. High-Pressure Fuel Shutoff Valve

#### 4.1 Original Design Requirements

##### 4.1.1 Technical Requirements Description
When the aircraft is stationary, the low-pressure switch is open, and the shutoff valve is closed, no significant fuel leakage through the closed shutoff valve to the engine is permitted. In the closed position (see Section 4.1.9), the high-pressure fuel shutoff valve shall drain fuel from the main and secondary fuel circuit pipelines. The engine employs a single pilot-operated lever via a cam box to independently actuate both the CASC and the high-pressure fuel shutoff valve; the system shall accommodate this single-lever control.

##### 4.1.2 Fuel Pressure and Temperature
Maximum fuel pressure is **1930 psi (gauge pressure)**. Under steady-state conditions, fuel temperature shall range from **-40°C to +135°C**.

##### 4.1.3 Maximum Fuel Flow Rate
The maximum steady-state operating fuel flow through this device is **11,120 gallons/hour**. The instantaneous maximum fuel flow rate is approximately **25% higher** than the maximum steady-state flow.

##### 4.1.4 Minimum Flow Characteristic Number
When the high-pressure shutoff valve is fully open, the minimum flow characteristic number is **240 gallons/hour/√psi** (fuel specific gravity = 0.79).

##### 4.1.5 Filtration
A low-pressure fuel filter is installed upstream of the fuel pump. This filter shall have the following characteristics:
- (i) Filter out at least **95%** of all **10-micron** particles.
- (ii) The maximum particle size passing through the filter shall not exceed **40 microns**.

##### 4.1.6 Lever Torque and Travel
Under **International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) sea-level conditions**, the lever torque required to rapidly close the high-pressure shutoff valve in any operating state shall not exceed **4 lb·in**.
The total angular travel of the high-pressure shutoff valve between the open and closed positions shall be as shown in the relevant drawing.

##### 4.1.7 Fuel
This device shall be designed to operate normally with any of the following fuels within the temperature and pressure ranges specified in Section 4.1.2:

| AVTUR | JP1 |
|-------|-----|
| AVTAG | JP4 |
| AVCAT | JP5 |

Fuel may or may not contain **0.1–0.15% (by volume)** anti-icing additive.

##### 4.1.8 Fuel Contamination
When using fuels specified in Section 4.1.7 that are contaminated in accordance with relevant British Ministry specifications, this device shall operate satisfactorily. However, endurance testing must comply with standards agreed upon by Rolls-Royce and the customer for specific applications.
The device may also be internally contaminated by **saltwater (seawater)**.

##### 4.1.9 Permissible Leakage of High-Pressure Fuel Shutoff Valve
In the closed position, using fuels specified in Section 4.1.7 at temperatures specified in Section 4.1.2, with a fuel pressure of **50 psi (gauge)**, the maximum permissible leakage shall not exceed **50 mL/hour** (drained leakage).

---

### 4.2 Design Features of the High-Pressure Fuel Shutoff Valve
The high-pressure fuel shutoff valve connects the fuel manifold to the high-pressure fuel control system. In addition to draining fuel from the fuel manifold to the fuel drain system when closed, it is designed to prevent transient overpressure in the high-pressure fuel system during sudden shutdown and maintain cooling flow through the high-pressure fuel system during engine shutdown.

The high-pressure fuel shutoff valve is located downstream of the low-pressure shaft controller and CASC, outside the high-pressure fuel pump servo loop. It is an **axial sliding plunger-type valve** operated by a rack-and-pinion gear pair. The actuating mechanism is linked to the engine control cam box and connected via linkage to the pilot’s control lever. The shutoff valve can be set to two positions: **open or closed**. In the open position, both main and secondary fuel flows pass through the shutoff valve. In the closed position, the slide valve or plunger cuts off fuel supply to the main and secondary nozzles; simultaneously, the two high-pressure fuel inlet channels and the high-pressure fuel pump servo circuit are connected to the low-pressure fuel outlet. The high-pressure fuel pump follow-up piston senses low pressure, causing the pump to immediately move to minimum stroke. This creates a low-pressure fuel circuit through the valve during engine shutdown, preventing transient overpressure (which could otherwise occur) and providing cooling flow through the high-pressure fuel system.

To ensure minimal operating torque, the slide valve is not fitted with seals but relies on extremely precise small clearances (**0.0001–0.0002 inches**) for sealing.

The slide valve and sleeve are made of **high-expansion stainless steel** and **aluminum bronze**, respectively, with nearly identical thermal expansion coefficients.

---

### 5. Boundary Layer Control (BLC) Supplementary Fuel Solenoid Valve
When **12th-stage air** is extracted for boundary layer control, the engine’s steady-state fuel flow must be increased to prevent engine speed drop and generator "offline" conditions. The increase in fuel flow is achieved by controlling a solenoid valve installed in the CASC bypass. When energized, the valve opens, allowing fuel to enter the main nozzle circuit. A **flow characteristic number of 2.0 gallons/hour/√psi** orifice is installed downstream of the solenoid valve. The technical requirements for this valve are detailed in **ACS9007 (Reference 7.2)**.

### Technical Design Report
**TDR 7754**
**Spey MK202: Secondary Nozzle Fuel Flow Characteristics Relative to Main Nozzle Fuel Flow**

**Issue 1**
**25 April 1975**

#### Purpose
To provide the latest relationship between secondary nozzle fuel flow and main nozzle fuel flow, enabling calibration of the flowmeter installed in the main fuel circuit to read the total engine fuel flow.

The relationship between main and secondary nozzle fuel flows can be adjusted by changing the servo pressure drop.

---

### 1.0 Introduction
Total engine fuel flow is metered by a flowmeter installed in the main fuel circuit. This is achieved by calibrating the flowmeter so that when main nozzle fuel flow passes through it, it indicates the sum of main and secondary fuel flows. Changing the servo characteristics alters the relationship between main and secondary nozzle fuel flows, necessitating recalibration of the flowmeter. This report provides the new relationship between main and secondary nozzle fuel flows for flowmeter recalibration.

---

### 2.0 Assumptions and Calculations
- **Main nozzle total flow characteristic number** = **55 gallons/hour/√psi**
- **Secondary nozzle total flow characteristic number** = **2.5 gallons/hour/√psi**
  The above flow characteristic numbers are nominal values.

#### 2.2 Pump Flow for Servo Pressure Drop Measurement
The pump flow for measuring servo pressure drop is assumed to be **1.33 times** the engine’s required fuel flow. This coefficient accounts for leakage and other factors under cruise conditions. Since the flowmeter is required to measure most accurately during cruise, this coefficient was selected.

### 2.3 Variable Metering Orifice (VMO) Pressure Drop:

\[
\Delta P_{\text{VMO}} = \left( \frac{N_H}{1264} \right)^2
\]

### 2.4 Servo Pressure Drop ( \(\Delta P_s\) ) Characteristics

The servo pressure drop characteristics are presented in chart DC14733 as a function of pump flow (see Section 2.2) and high-pressure shaft speed \(N_H\).

### 2.5 Influence of High-Pressure Fuel Shutoff Valve

Compared to other factors, the influence of the high-pressure fuel shutoff valve is minimal and thus neglected in calculations. For the same reason, pressure drops caused by piping are also ignored. Since both factors appear in the following two equations and largely cancel each other out during calculations, the adopted calculation method minimizes the impact of ignoring these two factors.

### 2.6 Pump Pressure Derivation

Pump pressure can be derived via two pathways: one through the main fuel circuit and the other through the secondary fuel circuit. The resulting equations are:

\[
P_{\Delta P} = P_3 + \Delta P_s + \Delta P_{\text{MB}}
\]

\[
P_P = P_3 + \Delta P_{\text{VMO}} + \Delta P_{\text{PB}}
\]

Where:

\(\Delta P_{\text{MB}}\)

Combining equations (1) and (2) yields:

\[
\Delta P_{\text{PB}} = \Delta P_s - \Delta P_{\text{VMO}} + \Delta P_{\text{MB}}
\]

By assuming a main nozzle fuel flow, a \(\Delta P_{\text{MB}}\) can be calculated; then, the allowable \(\Delta P_{\text{PB}}\) and secondary nozzle fuel flow can be determined.

Iterative calculations are required to ensure the sum of the main and secondary nozzle flows equals the total fuel flow demanded by the engine.

---

### Results

Using three flow relationship curves, a relationship curve between the secondary and main nozzle fuel flows is established. The given engine conditions are:

| Altitude       | Flight Mach Number | Atmospheric Conditions |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| (1) Sea Level  | Static              | International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) |
| (2) 25,000 ft  | 0.55                | International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) |
| (3) 41,000 ft  | 0.86                | International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) |

The results obtained from the above three flow relationship curves and the recommended flow calibration curve are shown in **Figure 1**.

### Abstract

By eliminating the segmented valve in the afterburner main fuel manifold and adopting high-pressure fuel injection, a device is required to introduce afterburner fuel only after the injection is complete, and then supply regulated fuel flow at a rate below that which would cause engine surge. This report describes how the acceleration control unit overflow valve fulfills these functions.

---

### Introduction

One function of the segmented valve is to control the rate of fuel flow increase into the fuel manifold to prevent sudden flow changes. With the elimination of the segmented valve (see TDR777), this function is lost, raising the issue of how to fill the manifold during afterburner engagement. Initially, the acceleration control unit overflow valve was used to perform both functions. However, as described in TDR7780, the overflow valve produced conflicting results for manifold filling, necessitating fuel injection into the manifold via a catalytic timer and igniter. This changes the requirements for the acceleration control unit overflow valve to:

1. Introduce afterburner fuel flow only after the manifold filling process is complete and the fuel in the evaporation trough is ignited.
2. After this process, smoothly introduce afterburner fuel to prevent sudden fuel flow changes.

The following outlines how the acceleration control unit overflow valve system accomplishes this process.

---

### Operation of the Acceleration Control Unit Overflow Valve

When afterburner engagement is initiated, a servo fuel signal from the catalytic ignition timer outlet is transmitted beneath the servo piston. The servo piston then moves upward to the stop point. The movement of the servo piston allows servo fuel beneath the main piston to flow to low pressure. At this time, a high-pressure differential across the control restrictor moves the main piston to the maximum overflow position. This occurs approximately 0.05 seconds after the start of the afterburner engagement sequence. Both the overflow valve servo piston and main piston remain in the maximum overflow position until the catalytic timer inlet closes.

Approximately 3.0 to 3.2 seconds after afterburner engagement, the catalytic timer inlet closes, cutting off the servo high-pressure fuel source to the servo piston, causing the servo piston servo pressure to drop to low pressure. Subsequently, the servo piston returns to its non-ignition afterburner position, once again cutting off the servo fuel leakage to low pressure beneath the main piston. The servo pressure beneath the main piston then begins to rise, causing the main piston to start moving toward the maximum non-overflow position. During this period, the speed of the main piston's movement depends on the rate of pressure increase beneath it. Typically, with a main piston servo pressure of 860 psi (gauge) and low pressure of 40 psi (gauge), the control restrictor size is determined to ensure the output flow increases from zero to maximum at a constant rate within 1.4 to 1.6 seconds. After 1.4 to 1.6 seconds from the overflow valve opening, the overflow valve is in the non-overflow position. Even if afterburner engagement is disengaged, the valve will remain in this position until the next afterburner engagement.

---

### Overflow Valve Operating Time

The fundamental design parameter for the overflow valve is the permissible fuel input rate for the afterburner system that does not cause engine surge after manifold filling. This fuel flow input rate is limited by the response rate of the exhaust nozzle to the commands given to it. As a design rule, the nozzle movement time is doubled to provide sufficient time margin to accommodate degradation in the nozzle control system's operation.

For a well-designed nozzle system, the time to move between fully closed and fully open positions is 1.2 seconds. During most of this nozzle movement, the nozzle hydraulic pump operates at full stroke. Therefore, during afterburner engagement, most of the hydraulic pump's stroke should also be at full stroke, allowing a direct estimation of the nozzle movement time. The estimated time for the nozzle to move from the pre-open position to the planned maximum afterburner area position is 0.7 seconds. This time is confirmed by the nozzle displacement record curve shown in **Figure 1**.

Doubling this time results in a movement time of 1.4 seconds, providing a lower limit for the operating time (i.e., the fastest time at which fuel can be introduced into the afterburner system). This lower limit is set based on the requirement to achieve the selected afterburner level within 5 seconds of engagement. Thus, with the catalytic timer occupying 3.2 seconds before the overflow valve opens, considering a 0.2-second margin, the upper limit for the operating time is 1.6 seconds.

### Spey MK202: Dual and Triple Taper Needle Valves in the Pressure Ratio Regulator

**First Edition: October 19, 1976**

---

### Abstract

The requirements for the \(P_3/P_6\) orifice needle valve profile in the pressure ratio regulator are somewhat contradictory: fast response requires a small taper, while stability requires a steeper taper. This document traces the evolution from the initial linear high-gain needle valve to the current solution—a triple-tapered nonlinear needle valve that balances these requirements. Additionally, this document outlines these conflicting requirements and the means by which the system achieves them.

### Introduction

The pressure ratio regulator is a sensing component of the closed-loop nozzle control system, primarily responsible for transmitting a signal to the nozzle hydraulic pump. This signal should relate to the error in \(P_6\), which is the difference between the actual \(P_6\) and the desired \(P_6\) for a given \(P_3/P_2\) (i.e., engine condition). This is because the nozzle hydraulic pump acts as an integrator and incorporates the signal from the pressure ratio regulator. In steady-state, a fixed signal value is required to ensure the nozzle hydraulic pump flow precisely matches the flow needed to compensate for leakage and cooling of the nozzle actuator. This fixed steady-state control position is called the null position.

Following conventional practice, the system uses direct-acting pressure to drive a rotary piston, providing a signal that makes the system simpler and more reliable. The rotary piston eliminates hysteresis caused by static friction in stationary pistons. On one side of the \(P_3/P_6\) piston, the actual \(P_6\) acts, while on the other side, the designed \(P_6\) acts, with both sides having equal areas. The designed \(P_6\) is a pressure between \(P_3\) and \(P_0\), and the areas of two orifices in the system are variable. The area of the \(P_3/P_6\) orifice is changed by the movement of a needle valve integrated with the piston within the orifice. In steady-state, the pressure ratio regulator signal piston is in a fixed position, so the corresponding orifice area is also fixed. Since the pressure ratios \(P_6/P_0\) and \(P_3/P_6\) both exceed choking values, the airflow is continuous and considered isothermal, making the upstream pressures of these two orifices equal to the ratio of their respective areas. When the downstream \(P_3/P_6\) orifice is fixed in steady-state, by selecting the upstream orifice's trim orifice area, we can obtain the correct value of \(P_6\). At this point, there is a single-valued relationship between \(P_3/P_2\) and \(P_3/P_6\), and the pressure ratio regulator generates a signal linearly related to \(P_3/P_2\) (see TPR7789). This signal can be used to adjust the trim needle valve in the orifice, so at a certain \(P_3/P_2\), the required \(P_6\) is achieved in steady-state. In fact, there are two \(P_3\) trim needle valves: one for normal engine operation and another for when boundary layer control is engaged. The use of boundary layer control changes the main engine operating line, thus altering the relationship between \(P_3/P_2\) and the required \(P_3/P_6\). The \(P_3\) signal supplied to the trim needle valve is regulated by the boundary layer control switching valve. Thus, in flight conditions, the trim needle valve adjusts the upstream orifice area, creating the main reference pressure \(P_6\) on one side of the pressure ratio regulator piston. If the actual \(P_6\) differs from the reference \(P_6\), the piston moves. This piston movement changes the needle valve position, thereby altering the downstream orifice area. The shape of the needle valve ensures the system can stably adjust, moving the piston to a position away from the null. The amount of piston movement depends on the needle valve profile and the pressure difference on both sides of the piston. For a given needle valve profile, the piston movement becomes a measure of the pressure difference or the difference between the actual \(P_6\) and the reference \(P_6\). The pressure ratio regulator...

### Translation

The piston movement adjusts the swashplate angle of the nozzle oil pump, driving the exhaust nozzle to bring the actual **P₈** closer to the reference **P₆**. During this adjustment, the pressure on both sides of the piston reverses, moving the piston to balance the pressure, and the downstream orifice area is again used as the controller. This causes the nozzle pump stroke to return to zero, slowing the rate of change of the nozzle area. The system then moves toward a steady-state position until it stabilizes at zero.

From the above, it is evident that the profile of the needle valve has a significant impact on system operation. For example, a needle valve with a very small taper produces an extremely fast system response. A small-taper needle valve requires a large displacement to change the orifice area sufficiently to balance any pressure difference on either side of the piston. As a result, the oil pump is pushed to a large stroke position far from zero, rapidly moving the actuator. However, there is a time lag between changes in **P₈** and the pressure from the pressure ratio regulator (actual **P₆** to the piston). If the response time is not coordinated with the lag, it may cause nozzle instability. On the other hand, a large-taper needle valve requires only a small displacement to achieve the required change in the oil pump swashplate angle, avoiding stability issues. However, these small changes result in minor variations in oil flow, leading to a slow system response, which is unacceptable for systems requiring rapid tracking of fuel flow changes. Therefore, the focus of this document is to find a compromise between these two extremes.

Factors affecting nozzle instability also include static friction in the nozzle oil actuator and the piston of the pressure ratio regulator. These forces have been minimized as much as possible. The static friction in the pressure ratio regulator piston is caused by the sealing device rotating with the piston. Fixing this sealing device effectively eliminates this source of static friction. Thus, design efforts are required to reduce static friction in the oil actuator. Clearly, the issue of side loads should be addressed in the initial design phase, as resolving it effectively reduces static friction.

### Downstream Needle Valve Design

The original design of this needle valve is shown in **Figure 2 of TDR779** (attached to TDR7789). As seen in the document, this needle valve has a very small taper, with a gain of approximately **0.9 in/turbine pressure ratio** (the evolution of the needle valve profile is shown in **Figure 1**). The needle valve profile design provides a linear relationship between needle valve displacement and orifice area, making **P₃/P₆** approximately linear with needle valve displacement. The small-taper profile provides a very fast time response but leads to system instability. We have tested many needle valves with different tapers, each showing a clear linear relationship between **P₃/P₈** and needle valve displacement. The primary limitation for slow nozzle movement is the rate of change in afterburner fuel flow. It has been found that a needle valve with a gain of **0.208 in/turbine pressure ratio** provides the slowest acceptable nozzle response for the fuel system. This needle valve offers a compromise between slow responses that may cause surge and fast unstable responses, but it is not entirely satisfactory.

To eliminate acceleration surge, a needle valve was adopted with a gain of **0.208 in/turbine pressure ratio** in the nozzle closing direction and a boundary gain of **0.2 pressure ratio** in the nozzle opening direction. When the gain exceeds the boundary value, the corresponding profile of the needle valve is a cylindrical section with a diameter equal to that corresponding to the boundary value. For details on improvements and engine test validation of this system, see **FDR10311**.

Since this system overcomes some surge issues, it is quite stable and operates without problems in the opening direction. However, operation in the closing direction remains somewhat sluggish. Given that nonlinear elements have already been introduced into the system, it was considered that additional nonlinear elements might be needed to accelerate the response time in the closing direction. To this end, a small-taper profile with a gain of approximately **0.5 in/pressure ratio** replaced the closing taper profile beyond the **0.425 pressure ratio** boundary. This profile is currently in use and operates without faults in both the nozzle opening and closing directions.

To simplify needle valve manufacturing, the needle valve profile has been greatly simplified by making it conical, resulting in minor gain variations along the needle valve profile segment. However, these variations are insignificant in the closing profile segment, as this segment is a high-gain region, and the opening direction profile segment is cylindrical. The actual length of the entire adjustment profile segment is only **0.125 inches**, so gain variations along this segment can be neglected. It has been confirmed that these small variations are negligible in operation. This type of needle valve profile is acceptable and is currently in use.

### **1.0 Introduction**

#### **1.1**
To achieve surge-free acceleration during afterburner operation, the nozzle opening rate must not be less than the rate of increase in afterburner fuel supply. This requirement cannot be met with the existing standard afterburner fuel system and nozzle control system.

#### **1.2**
Clearly, there are two possible solutions:
- **(a)** The nozzle system can control the rate of increase in afterburner fuel supply. This principle is the basis of the afterburner acceleration controller.
- **(b)** The nozzle opening rate can be increased to be greater than or equal to the maximum rate of afterburner fuel increase.

#### **1.3**
Method **(b)** is advantageous because it minimizes acceleration time. However, simply increasing the gain of the nozzle system is not suitable, as it would make the system unstable. A **nonlinear gain characteristic pressure ratio regulator** has been tested. To maintain normal operating deviations near the stable value, we retain the current gain of **0.208 in/turbine pressure ratio** error, commonly referred to as the **zero-speed point**. If the turbine pressure ratio error exceeds a predetermined value (hereafter referred to as the **boundary value**), the gain becomes infinite. This can be achieved by designing the downstream **P₃/P₆** pressure divider needle valve profile as a constant cross-section.

---

### **2.0 Conclusions**

#### **2.1**
Tests to date indicate that a **dual-gain P₃/P₈ needle valve** is a satisfactory solution for preventing surge during rapid afterburner acceleration.

#### **2.2**
When the boundary value is adjusted to **0.2 turbine pressure ratio error**, the peak error near surge during rapid acceleration from **maximum military power** to **maximum afterburner** at sea level static conditions does not exceed **0.43**.

---

### **3.0 System and Test Description**

#### **3.1 Engine No. 38**
The pressure ratio regulator boundary value was adjusted to **0.2 pressure ratio**, near surge, for rapid acceleration from **minimum afterburner** and **maximum military power** to various afterburner ratios.

When fuel is sprayed into the catalytic igniter, the main afterburner fuel returns to the boost pump inlet via the spill valve. Thus, during rapid acceleration from **maximum military power** to **maximum afterburner**, the closing rate of the spill valve determines the rate of fuel increase. During rapid acceleration from **minimum afterburner** to **maximum afterburner**, the control element is the rotary valve.

#### **3.2 Universal Test Rig**
The above tests were conducted on a universal test rig by adjusting different boundary values. **Figures 2 and 3** show the peak pressure ratio error near surge during rapid throttle acceleration at various speeds. The closest test to the **Engine No. 38** test conditions was **Test 83**, where the boundary value was adjusted to approximately **0.18** (the spill valve was not installed on the universal test rig during testing). At this adjustment, the recorded peak error during rapid acceleration from **maximum military power** was **0.36**. Reducing the boundary value also reduces the peak error but makes the system prone to instability.

#### **3.3 Nozzle Speed**
The maximum nozzle speed recorded during testing on **Engine No. 38** was **435 in/s**. The **H346 nozzle** was equipped with a small-area non-flight-standard nozzle actuator. Based on this, the maximum expected speed on a standard flight nozzle is **356 in/s**. Since this speed just exceeds the average nozzle speed (**230 in/s**) required to maintain a stable pressure ratio error when fuel flow increases at the maximum rate, it can be concluded that this device, when used with a standard flight nozzle, will exhibit satisfactory characteristics.

## Introduction

Afterburning is a convenient method for obtaining short-term thrust augmentation during takeoff, climb, or high-speed aircraft maneuvers. The primary disadvantage of this system is that, compared to any other method of achieving the same thrust increase, the specific fuel consumption during afterburning is higher, and the system itself is relatively bulky. To increase thrust, larger engines with greater weight and frontal area are typically required. The advantage of using an afterburner is that it provides a high-velocity exhaust jet for supersonic flight. To achieve high-velocity exhaust, the gas temperature must be raised to levels that the turbine cannot withstand. Afterburning is also affected by the combustion of fuel in the mixed inner and outer bypass flows downstream of the turbine. This combustion mode relies on unburned oxygen in the exhaust to sustain combustion. As detailed in TDR7789, for high-bypass-ratio engines with afterburning, precise fuel scheduling and a closed-loop exhaust nozzle control system are required to achieve the necessary accuracy and performance. In summary, due to pressure changes caused by fuel combustion in the exhaust nozzle, an exhaust nozzle regulator is required. If the exhaust nozzle area is not adjustable, backpressure propagates through the outer bypass duct to the low-pressure compressor, affecting the engine’s operating line. Therefore, an exhaust nozzle area regulator is needed to maintain the correct backpressure.

The beginning of this report outlines the transformation and selection of basic parameters used to determine and schedule the appropriate afterburner fuel flow to the fuel manifold. The concluding section explains how these functions and parameters are incorporated into the fuel control components to achieve afterburner fuel regulation.

### Selection of Basic Parameters

The requirement for the afterburner system is to operate satisfactorily under all engine and aircraft flight conditions. Thus, the afterburner fuel flow must be scheduled such that the dimensionless fuel flow varies uniquely with the dimensionless engine speed (i.e., the relationship between \( F_R / P_1 \sqrt{T_1} \) and \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \) is single-valued).

Based on this single-valued relationship, it is theoretically possible to design a fuel controller that directly schedules the afterburner fuel flow. However, during high-speed flight, particularly during transient maneuvers, the parameters \( P_1 \) and \( T_1 \) are difficult to measure. By multiplying the fuel flow parameter by the dimensionless group \( \sqrt{T_1} / N_H \), the \( T_1 \) term can be eliminated, yielding the dimensionless group \( F_R / P_1 N_H \). Since any compressor pressure ratio (or temperature ratio) has a clear single-valued relationship with \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \) (ignoring ram effects, as ram ratio has minimal impact within the afterburning range, and neglecting specific heat effects), \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \) can be replaced by a pressure ratio (e.g., \( P_3 / P_1 \)). Thus, the fuel flow is regulated based on the single-valued relationship between \( F_R / P_1 N_H \) and \( P_3 / P_1 \).

Absolute pressures are difficult to measure (requiring an absolute vacuum as a reference). However, pressure differences are relatively easy to measure accurately. Mathematical transformations of dimensionless groups do not affect their dimensionless nature. Therefore, if two ratios, such as \( P_3 / P_6 \) and \( P_6 / P_1 \), have a single-valued relationship with \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \), then their difference also has a single-valued relationship with \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \). Thus, this new parameter \( (P_3 / P_1 - P_6 / P_1) \) also has a single-valued relationship with \( F_R / P_1 N_H \).

As mentioned earlier, \( P_1 \) is difficult to measure, so it is convenient to eliminate this parameter from both terms of the above relationship. If the scheduling plan can be made linear and pass through the origin, \( P_1 \) can be eliminated from the two dimensionless groups. This linearization can be achieved by introducing another parameter that has a single-valued relationship with \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \). To this end, the pressure ratio is adjusted to make the fuel scheduling plan linear and pass through the origin. If \( K \) is the new parameter and \( C \) is the proportionality constant between the two dimensionless groups, then the fuel flow relationship becomes:

\[
F_R = C N_H (K P_3 - P_6)
\]

where \( K \) and \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \) have a single-valued relationship, and thus also with the pressure ratio. Since \( P_3 / P_2 \) is the easiest to measure, let \( K = f_n (P_3 / P_2) \). The relationship then becomes:

\[
F_R = C N_H \left[ f_n \left( \frac{P_3}{P_2} \right) P_3 - P_6 \right]
\]

For most modern afterburner applications, there is an additional requirement for afterburner augmentation ratio control, i.e., modulation control, allowing the pilot to select the desired level of afterburner thrust. Since thrust is approximately linearly related to fuel flow, the afterburner thrust modulation control is proportional to the afterburner fuel flow. Thus, the afterburner fuel flow equation becomes:

\[
F_R = C \beta N_H \left[ f_n \left( \frac{P_3}{P_2} \right) P_3 - P_6 \right]
\]

This equation remains dimensionless, and the terms on the right-hand side are easily measurable. Thus, in the control system, a hydromechanical system is used to obtain the scheduled afterburner fuel flow based on the parameters on the right-hand side. The method for achieving the scheduled fuel flow is explained below.

The equation transformations listed above, made to obtain a reasonably simple afterburner fuel control system, use selected practical parameters. The primary reason for preferring these parameters over others is that they are easily implemented, in many cases serve additional functions, and provide a system with precise and stable control.

### Control Mechanism for Fuel Scheduling

The above transformations of dimensionless groups were made based on some of the most easily obtainable functional forms. When considering the mechanism of the control device, different approaches and starting points can yield the same equation. The considerations made in designing the Spey afterburner system are described below, re-establishing the control equation and explaining how each part of the equation is implemented by the control devices.

From first principles, the fuel flow must be directly related to a function of the engine air mass flow. If this is not achieved, there is a risk that the fuel flow will exceed the stoichiometric value, leading to a tendency for rich blowout. Therefore, some method must be found to measure the engine’s total air mass flow and schedule the corresponding afterburner fuel flow based on this total air mass flow.

In engines without an outer bypass duct, this requirement is relatively easy to achieve. Such engines typically use afterburning only beyond the upper limit of the engine’s operating range, where the compressor can be considered choked. At this point, there is a simple relationship between the compressor outlet pressure and the air mass flow through it. The fuel schedule can then be built around this parameter. However, in turbofan engines, the selection of basic parameters is more challenging. In this case, no single parameter can determine the air mass flow function. Since the core engine operates between choked states, the air mass flow through the core engine is easily determined. However, the air mass flow at the outer bypass duct outlet is not as easily determined and is unrelated to the same parameters used to determine the core engine air mass flow. A compromise can be found by multiplying the core engine air mass flow by a coefficient to approximate the total air mass flow under typical engine operating conditions. A correction coefficient is then used to account for variations in the outer bypass air mass flow. Finally, \( P_3 \) is taken as a measure of the core engine air mass flow and thus as the foundation for the entire control system.

The bypass ratio, or the ratio of outer bypass air mass flow to core engine air mass flow, is determined by \( T_1 \) and the low-pressure compressor speed, both of which are related to \( T_1 \). Since a high bypass ratio has the same effect as a high \( T_1 \), a correction for \( T_1 \) is needed. However, \( T_1 \) itself is difficult to measure, especially during rapid transients, as thermocouples have a longer time constant compared to the engine system, increasing error. Examining how errors affect the required fuel flow provides a clue to solving the problem. When the actual \( T_1 \) is higher (i.e., high bypass ratio), the air mass flow is greater than indicated by the \( P_3 \) signal, and the fuel-air ratio is lower. Therefore, more fuel flow is needed. Conversely, when \( T_1 \) is low, the air mass flow is lower than indicated by \( P_3 \), requiring less fuel flow. We can derive a function of \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \), but the measurement of \( T_1 \) remains problematic. Thus, \( P_3 / P_2 \) is taken as the correction function. When the high-pressure compressor is choked, \( P_3 / P_2 \) varies uniquely with \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \). The function can thus be built around \( P_3 / P_2 \). The shape of the function is shown in Figure 1, which illustrates the correction to \( P_3 \).

The \( P_3 / P_2 \) signal is derived from the pressure ratio regulator, a specialized device whose operation is detailed in TDR7789. Its primary function is to position a needle valve within an orifice based on the pressure balance between \( P_2 \) and the \( P_3 \) pressure divided through a throttling orifice to \( P_0 \). The positioning of this needle valve depends on the pressures \( P_3 \) and \( P_2 \), as well as the profile shape of the needle valve. The method for deriving the correction term is discussed in the section on needle valve profiling in TDR7789. The position of the needle valve within its orifice is transmitted via a mechanical linkage to an air signal generator controlled by \( P_3 / P_2 \). In this device, a rack-and-pinion mechanism positions the needle valve in an orifice where \( P_3 \) air pressure is divided to \( P_6 \). This \( P_3 \) pressure division term is used to determine the fuel flow, as this division is related to the required \( P_3 / P_2 \). The profile of the pressure divider needle valve, which satisfies system requirements and provides the correct \( P_3 \) signal shape, is developed by the manufacturer (as shown in Figure 1).

As mentioned in previous sections, measuring absolute pressure requires an absolute vacuum as a reference. In practice, this is not feasible in a simple, low-cost, and reliable system. Instead, measuring the difference between two pressures and balancing this pressure difference with a spring force is more practical. To provide the most convenient measurement, the secondary pressure should be small, i.e., providing the maximum possible pressure difference, so that measurement inaccuracies result in minimal error. The choice of secondary pressure is resolved between \( P_1 \) and \( P_6 \). The primary consideration is signal measurability, and in this regard, \( P_1 \) is more difficult to measure because the \( P_1 \) probe requires anti-icing to prevent signal loss at low \( T_1 \). Therefore, \( P_6 \) is chosen as the selected parameter. The term for scheduling fuel flow becomes \( f \left[ \left( \frac{P_3}{P_2} \right) P_3 - P_6 \right] \) (for ease of reference, this term is also called \( P_b \)).

For simplicity, direct-acting pressures are used as much as possible in the controller. Thus, the pressure function \( P_b \) is formed by balancing the two pressure terms in the above function against a spring at both ends of a rotating hollow valve. The position of the fuel metering valve is uniquely related to \( P_b \). The fuel metering valve is included in the Vaporizing Gutter Flow Metering Valve (VGFMV), which schedules the vaporizing gutter fuel flow. As the fuel metering valve moves from one end of its stroke to the other, the opening of the VGFMV gradually increases. Therefore, since \( P_b \) has a single-valued relationship with the fuel metering valve position, and the valve position determines the valve opening, this establishes a single-valued relationship between \( P_b \) and the valve opening. However, what is needed is the relationship between \( P_b \) and the fuel flow. If the pressure difference across the valve is constant, the fuel flow depends solely on the valve opening. This constraint must be established in the control device.

The Vaporizing Gutter Flow Pressure Differential Regulator (VGFPDR) maintains a constant pressure drop across the valve, approximately 100 psi. The total scheduled afterburner fuel enters the VGFPDR, and most of it is bypassed to the fuel manifold. The position of the fuel metering valve allows sufficient fuel to return to maintain a pressure difference of approximately 100 psi across the VGFMV. This is achieved by balancing the main manifold fuel pressure, spring force, and bypass pressure (fuel manifold pressure and vaporizing gutter outlet pressure).

The vaporizing gutter is required to maintain a stable fuel combustion core, with the remaining afterburner fuel burning around this core. Therefore, under given flight conditions (or \( P_b \) value), the size of the VGFMV is determined to supply approximately 10% of the maximum afterburner total fuel flow. This fuel flow is independent of the afterburner augmentation ratio modulation. Thus, the valve size introduces a correction coefficient (a constant combination), and the vaporizing gutter flow is independent of other variables. It should be noted that during engine operation, the various fuel metering valves are continuously rotating, which is a design feature of the fuel metering valves to avoid friction impeding the response of the fuel metering valve to small changes in control pressure.

However, the vaporizing gutter flow is related only to the maximum afterburner fuel flow required under flight conditions and can be determined solely by \( P_b \). As mentioned above, the total afterburner fuel flow is related not only to the flight conditions defined by \( P_b \) but also to the pilot-selected afterburner augmentation ratio. The Total Flow Metering Valve (TFMV) must account for both parameters. Furthermore, fuel flows through the valve positioned by \( P_b \) and the pilot’s throttle lever. The combined input command of \( P_b \) and the pilot’s throttle lever is achieved by a linkage connecting the VGFMV and TFMV, with a variable fulcrum on the pilot’s afterburner selection lever. The fuel metering valve of the VGFMV is positioned only by \( P_b \) (flight conditions), so this small shaft fulcrum acts as a variable fulcrum for the linkage. The fulcrum is a roller within a slot in the linkage. The roller is actually positioned by the linkage from the pilot’s afterburner selection lever. The fuel metering valve of the TFMV is thus positioned by these two parameters. The positioning of the fulcrum roller is achieved by a signal from the pilot’s lever, converted through a rack-and-pinion, cam, and follower mechanism into the position of the slider on the lever.

Additionally, the combination of \( P_b \) and the pilot’s throttle lever is used only to position the fuel metering valve, thus determining the size of the TFMV opening. However, what is required is to determine the needed fuel flow. As previously mentioned, this requires regulating the pressure difference across the valve to provide this relationship. The Main Pressure Differential Regulator (MPDR) serves this function by controlling the pressure difference across the valve. The MPDR is set by balancing the total afterburner fuel pressure, adjusting the rotary valve servo piston signal. This adjusts the afterburner fuel pump inlet throttle valve, thus supplying the required fuel flow while maintaining a constant pressure difference across the TFMV.

The system described above can schedule the appropriate vaporizing gutter fuel flow, and the total afterburner flow is related to the afterburner augmentation ratio and the pressure term \( P_b \). Thus, the size of the TFMV opening can provide the correct afterburner fuel flow at maximum \( N_H \). This is suitable for a system where \( N_H \) remains nearly constant within the operating range. However, in the Spey, under certain flight conditions, \( N_H \) can drop by up to 10% due to fine adjustments in the main engine fuel flow. The \( P_b \) term causes \( N_H \) to decrease (i.e., when \( T_1 \) is constant, \( N_H / \sqrt{T_1} \) decreases), just as an increased bypass ratio requires more fuel. The shaping of \( P_3 / P_2 \) provides the additional fuel required when \( T_1 \) changes, which is exactly opposite to the correction needed for \( N_H \) variation. Therefore, an additional \( N_H \) term is needed.

Thus, a linear relationship is required between \( N_H \) and the fuel flow. Once the fuel flow is determined by the valve opening, the required relationship is between \( N_H \) and \( \sqrt{\Delta P} \). In the MPDR, the pressure difference causes the required valve opening to change, so a device providing \( N_H^2 \) can achieve the necessary correction. A pair of centrifugal flyweights in the MPDR provides exactly this relationship. If \( N_H \) decreases, the rotary valve servo piston is adjusted to reduce the fuel flow.

Since the centrifugal flyweights are immersed in fuel, changes in fuel specific gravity affect the action of the flyweights, requiring an additional term. The fuel schedule is based on mass flow, but the scheduling system provides volumetric flow, leading to changes in fuel mass flow. However, by appropriately selecting the flyweight material, the effect of fuel specific gravity changes on the flyweights can be used to largely offset changes in fuel mass flow.

The profile of the TFMV allows for adjustments to the combustion efficiency (\( \alpha_R \)) margin. The theoretical fuel schedule derived in the previous section is realized in practice in the engine. The afterburner fuel schedule curve is shown in Figure 2 of TDR7788. It can be seen that the fuel schedule is nonlinear, with the lower nonlinearity caused by the combustion efficiency term, and the remaining nonlinearity resulting from necessary modifications to the TFMV profile during development.

### Fuel Supply Nozzles

So far, only the determination and derivation of the correct afterburner fuel flow have been discussed. However, the afterburner system has other considerations requiring several additional devices. The scheduled fuel flow must be delivered to the afterburner manifold at the appropriate time. The relationships between these auxiliary devices and the afterburner fuel scheduling system are explained below.

Early experience with afterburner systems showed that if the total afterburner fuel flow is burned through a single manifold system, there is a risk of lean blowout at low fuel flows. To address this issue, the Spey system employs a dual combustion system. One combustion system is the vaporizing gutter, which consumes approximately 10% of the maximum afterburner fuel flow under flight conditions. This fuel flow is essentially independent of the afterburner augmentation ratio modulation. The vaporizing gutter flow passes through three concentric vaporizing gutters, providing a stable and nearly constant fuel combustion core. The remaining scheduled afterburner fuel flows through another fuel manifold system. Four concentric annular manifolds face the engine’s vaporizing gutters, positioned between the vaporizing gutters, with catalytic igniters located at the center of the vaporizing gutters. The innermost manifold is blocked to prevent fuel from dripping onto the catalytic components, which could damage the catalytic igniter. Thus, although four manifolds are present in the current system, only the outermost three have fuel flowing through them. Fuel from the fuel manifolds flows around the vaporizing gutters and is ignited. Since afterburner modulation affects only the fuel flow in the fuel manifolds, the vaporizing gutter provides a stable combustion core, eliminating the risk of lean blowout. The fuel entering the respective combustion systems is scheduled by the VGFMV for the vaporizing gutter and by the TFMV for the entire system, with the difference being the scheduled fuel flow supplied to the manifolds.

Since the minimum afterburner fuel flow at high altitude is less than the maximum afterburner fuel flow at sea level, one requirement for the fuel pump is to avoid transferring too much heat to the fuel, preventing damage to the seals of components in contact with high-pressure fuel. Based on thermal balance, a vapor core pump transfers less heat to the fuel than a gear pump or centrifugal pump. For this application, the use of a vapor core pump is a satisfactory choice because it is much lighter and more economical compared to a plunger pump.

### Ignition Sequence

The above discussion addresses only the issue of afterburner ignition. The afterburner system also requires a programmed operation for afterburner selection. As a fundamental design feature of the Spey afterburner system, afterburning is required only when \( N_H \) is above 80%, and a device is incorporated into the system to prevent the pilot from abruptly advancing the throttle lever from idle into the afterburner range when \( N_H \) is below 80%. The 80% synchronization valve, as the name suggests, consists of a pair of centrifugal flyweights that overcome spring force to move the fuel metering valve. Above 80% \( N_H \), the fuel metering valve moves sufficiently to open various ports, allowing the afterburner device and exhaust nozzle actuator to operate. The 80% synchronization valve is connected in series with the pilot’s selection lever, functioning as an "AND" gate.

Above 80% \( N_H \), the pilot’s lever is the only selection lever. As described above, the signal from the pilot’s selection lever is transmitted to the TFMV to determine the selected afterburner augmentation ratio. The same signal is also transmitted to the afterburner selection valve. If the system is above 80% \( N_H \), when afterburning is engaged, one port of the afterburner selection valve opens, allowing servo fuel to flow through the 80% synchronization valve into the rotary valve servo piston of the vapor core pump inlet throttle valve, the exhaust nozzle actuator, and the air purge selection valve.

### Afterburner Fuel System Operation

Thus, the signal to the rotary valve servo piston causes the rotary valve to open, allowing the vapor core pump inlet to enlarge. Fuel then begins to supply the afterburner fuel scheduling system. The signal to the nozzle actuator valve adjusts the nozzle to a pre-open position, matching the nozzle position with the vapor gutter flow before afterburner ignition. The signal to the air purge selector valve cuts off the airflow through the vapor gutter. The presence of this purge air prevents carbon buildup around the fuel orifices in the manifold after afterburner cutoff.

The movement of the rotary valve servo piston not only opens the low-pressure shutoff valve (allowing fuel to flow to the scheduling system) but also opens an orifice to deliver engine main fuel to the catalytic ignition system. This fuel also serves as a signal to the PRCU (Pressure Ratio Control Unit), enabling the PRCU to control the nozzle lubrication pump and thus the nozzle position. The fuel to the catalytic igniter passes through the catalytic fuel flow control device, which essentially functions as a 3-second timer. After 3 seconds, the catalytic fuel supply stops. The main fuel passing through the catalytic timer is split, with part flowing into the catalytic igniter and part into the main fuel manifold. A signal is also sent to the afterburner control spill valve, moving the spill valve to its maximum spill position. All events described so far occur within an extremely short timeframe (on the order of 0.05 seconds), and reviewing the sequence during this specific period is useful.

Movement of the throttle lever causes servo fuel to open the low-pressure shutoff valve, activates the PRCU, cuts off vapor gutter purge air, and adjusts the nozzle to the pre-open position. Fuel flowing through the vapor core pump is delivered to the scheduling system for the vapor gutter and main fuel manifold. The catalytic fuel flow initiates the catalytic timer, the main fuel manifold begins to fill, and the main fuel (via the spill valve) is directed to low pressure, while also providing fuel for vapor gutter ignition.

The requirement for the afterburner ignition timer is that afterburner operation should take effect within 5 seconds of engagement. Before introducing main manifold fuel into the system, it is desirable for the system to stabilize as much as possible to ensure the vapor gutter establishes the required stable combustion core. However, the system has another constraint: the nozzle system must prevent fuel inflow to eliminate the possibility of surge. It has been demonstrated that the nozzle moves from the pre-open position to a stable afterburner position in approximately 0.7 seconds. As a design feature, it is preferable to introduce fuel only after twice the nozzle movement time, i.e., 1.4 seconds. Considering variations in components, an additional 0.2-second tolerance is added.

This leaves 3.4 seconds remaining in the 5-second window. Assuming a minimum 0.2-second tolerance, the time available for stabilizing vapor gutter fuel is 3.0 to 3.2 seconds. Within this timeframe, the catalytic timer allows fuel to flow into the igniter, to the acceleration control spill valve, and to fill the afterburner fuel manifold. The size of the manifold filling orifice is determined based on the fuel quantity to be injected into the fuel manifold within the specified timeframe under International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) sea-level static conditions, normal day, and takeoff state. Under other flight conditions, this flow rate may vary by approximately ±30% from the actual filling quantity. However, this shortcoming in the system is deemed acceptable.

After 3 to 3.2 seconds, the catalytic timer cuts off fuel to the catalytic igniter, leaving only the vapor gutter to sustain ignition. Fuel filling also stops, and the signal fuel to the acceleration control spill valve ceases simultaneously. The pressure in the acceleration control spill valve servo piston drops to low pressure, and the servo piston returns to its non-afterburning position. Servo pressure builds up beneath the main piston, moving it to the maximum non-spill position. The rate at which fuel is introduced into the fuel manifold is determined by the speed of the main piston movement, and the size of the control restrictor is set to meet the requirement of a 1.4 to 1.6-second movement time. Once the spill valve has fully moved to its non-spill position, the afterburner system begins operation. Thereafter, afterburner fuel acceleration and deceleration are controlled by restricting the rotary valve servo fuel.

### Afterburner Disengagement

Afterburner is disengaged by moving the throttle lever to the non-afterburning position. This actuates the spool valve in the afterburner selector valve, cutting off servo fuel to the nozzle actuator valve, rotary valve servo piston, and air purge selector valve. The actuator valve closes, rapidly reducing the nozzle to its non-afterburning position. The signal to the air purge selector valve is removed, allowing the valve to return to its non-afterburning position, and purge air flows through the vapor gutter manifold to clear residual fuel in the system, preventing carbon buildup in the vapor gutter orifices. Removal of servo fuel from the rotary valve servo piston closes the low-pressure shutoff valve, preventing fuel from flowing through the vapor core pump to the scheduling system. Closing the low-pressure shutoff valve also cuts off servo fuel to the PRCU, releasing nozzle control from the PRCU. The engine then operates normally as a non-afterburning engine.

|-------------------------|---------|
| Spey MK202 Afterburner Fuel Control System Design Requirements |         |

---

### Purpose

To establish the design requirements for the afterburner fuel system.

### 1. Requirements

The afterburner fuel control system shall:

1. Provide a device for modulating afterburner thrust.
2. Incorporate mechanical devices for afterburner startup and shutdown.
3. Schedule the total afterburner nozzle fuel flow based on engine condition and selected afterburner level.
4. Schedule the vapor gutter (pilot) nozzle fuel flow at engine speeds below a specified value.
5. Provide a hydraulic signal equivalent to approximately 80% of maximum \( N_H \) (high-pressure rotor speed) for afterburner engagement or disengagement.
6. Provide an independent afterburner startup control device for emergency use, allowing afterburner engagement at 80% of maximum \( N_H \).
7. Provide an air source to purge residual fuel from the vapor gutter manifold, main manifold, and main nozzle ring after afterburner cutoff.
8. Provide a device to deliver engine main fuel to the catalytic ignition system.
9. Provide a drive mechanism and mounting base for the pressure ratio device.

### 2. Engine

The engine is an afterburning twin-spool turbofan designed for all-weather fighter aircraft. The engine is installed in a near-horizontal plane.

### 3. Afterburner Engagement Speed Range

The afterburner system is fully modulated. Under normal flight conditions, afterburner is required only when the engine is at the maximum throttle position. For emergency use, a dedicated device allows afterburner engagement at 80% of maximum \( N_{H} \).

### 4. Engine Performance

Dimensionless curves for maximum afterburner fuel flow, low-pressure compressor outlet pressure, high-pressure compressor outlet pressure, and low-pressure turbine outlet pressure as a function of the parameter \( N_1 / \sqrt{T_1} \) are shown in Figures 1–4 of this report. The curve for the fuel flow coefficient required to calculate maximum afterburner fuel flow as a function of the corrected parameter f(P) is shown in Figure 2.

High-pressure compressor outlet static pressure is limited to 330 psi (gauge), and the ratio of high-pressure compressor outlet static pressure to total pressure is 0.97.

The variable nozzle ensures that the engine's dimensionless parameters remain constant across various afterburner ratios.

### 5. Afterburner System Requirements

#### 5.1 Afterburner Selector Valve (Normal Operation)

Afterburner is selected by moving the pilot's throttle lever, which actuates a valve supplying fuel to the afterburner fuel system.

A device shall be provided to ensure that any jamming in the afterburner control mechanism does not impede the use of the afterburner cutoff switch, main engine throttle lever, or shutdown switch.

For normal operation, afterburner startup and shutdown shall be achieved using non-electrical devices.

#### 5.2 Nozzles (Supplied by Rolls-Royce)

The afterburner fuel system shall work in conjunction with the following nozzle system.

##### 5.2.1 Pilot Fuel Nozzles

The nozzles on the pilot fuel manifold use a small portion of the total afterburner fuel. Changes in pilot throttle position and total afterburner fuel flow should not cause the fuel flow to the pilot nozzles to vary beyond the limits defined by the agreed test specifications. The nominal required flow is 10% of the maximum total afterburner fuel flow.

The fuel flow number for the pilot system is 29.5 gallons/hour/√psi. This value may change during development testing.

##### 5.2.2 Main Fuel Nozzles

The main fuel nozzles use the remaining portion of the total afterburner fuel flow. The main fuel system is divided into four parallel flow circuits, each with different flow numbers, tentatively set as follows:

| System | Flow Number (gallons/hour/√psi) |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| 1      | 16.8                             |
| 2      | 65.0                             |
| 3      | 116.0                            |
| 4      | 87.0                             |

All flow numbers are calculated based on a fuel specific gravity of 0.79.

#### 5.3 Afterburner Fuel Regulator

The afterburner fuel regulator schedules the total fuel flow to the afterburner combustor based on engine condition and selected afterburner level. The required fuel flow is determined by the following formula:

\[
F_R = \beta K_1 R \left[ f \left( \frac{P_3}{P_2} \right) P_3' - P_6' \right] N_H
\]

Where:
- \( F_R \): Total afterburner fuel flow (lb/hour)
- \( N_H \): High-pressure rotor speed (rpm)
- \( \beta \): Selected afterburner level (i.e., pilot throttle position)
- \( K_1 \): Constant
- \( f(P_3/P_2) \): Function of \( P_3/P_2 \)
- \( P_3 \): High-pressure compressor outlet total pressure (psia)
- \( p_3 \): High-pressure compressor outlet static pressure (psia)
- \( P_3' \): Regulator-measured high-pressure compressor outlet pressure (psia)
- \( P_2 \): Low-pressure compressor outlet total pressure (psia)
- \( P_6 \): Turbine outlet total pressure (psia)
- \( P_6' \): Regulator-measured turbine outlet pressure (psia)
- \( R \): Afterburner fuel flow correction factor

\( p_3 \) is sensed as static pressure, while \( P_2 \) and \( P_6 \) are sensed as total pressures.

The ratio of pressures at the regulator to total pressures at the sensing ports is given as:
\[
\frac{P_3'}{P_3} = 0.955 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{P_6'}{P_6} = 0.97
\]

The throttle lever movement is linked via an actuator to the \( P_3/P_2 \) ratio, making the throttle lever movement essentially linear with changes in the \( P_3/P_2 \) ratio. The total throttle lever travel occurs between pressure ratios of 2.86 and 8.31.

The afterburner level shall vary between 15% and 100% of maximum afterburner flow. The required minimum afterburner level may change during development testing.

The required minimum total afterburner fuel flow is the greater of 15% of maximum afterburner fuel flow or 2610 lb/hour. These values may change in the future.

#### 5.4 Pilot Nozzle Fuel Scheduling Control

The fuel flow to the pilot nozzles is scheduled similarly to the total afterburner fuel flow but is independent of pilot throttle lever movement and engine speed, as follows:

\[
F_{RP} = 0.10 K_1 \times 12640 \left[ f \left( \frac{P_3}{P_2} \right) P_3' - P_6' \right]
\]

Where:
- \( F_{RP} \): Afterburner fuel flow to pilot nozzles (lb/hour)
- Other symbols are as defined in Section 5.3.

The constant 0.10 may change during development testing.

#### 5.5 Afterburner Fuel Pump

The nominal maximum afterburner fuel flow required by the engine is 7000 gallons/hour, using any of the fuels specified in Section 10.

Servo devices may use a small amount of high-pressure fuel from the engine main system. Engine main fuel pressure is calculated as follows:

\[
P_p = P_3 + 300 + 3.78 \times 10^{-3} F_E + 5.4 \times 10^{-6} F_E^2
\]

Where:
- \( P_p \): Engine main fuel pressure (psia)
- \( P_3 \): High-pressure compressor outlet total pressure (psia)
- \( F_E \): Engine main fuel flow (lb/hour)

The maximum overload pressure is 1800 psi (gauge).

Mechanical drive is provided from the high-pressure compressor system. At an engine high-pressure rotor speed of 12,640 rpm, the drive speed is 21,045 rpm, rotating counterclockwise (viewed from the engine mounting face).

At 21,045 rpm, the maximum power output from the engine drive is 180 horsepower.

#### 5.6 Mechanical Drive Device

In addition to the pump drive mentioned in Section 5.5, a low-speed drive is also required from the engine high-pressure rotor. At a high-pressure rotor speed of 12,640 rpm, its speed is 396 rpm, rotating clockwise (viewed from the engine mounting face). At 396 rpm, the maximum power output from the low-speed engine drive is 5 horsepower.

The pressure ratio device is mounted on the afterburner fuel regulator and driven by a shaft on the afterburner fuel regulator, rotating counterclockwise (viewed from the mounting face) at the same speed as the low-speed drive.

At 396 rpm, the maximum power consumption of the pressure ratio device is 1 horsepower.

### Fuel Flow Distribution to Afterburner Main Fuel Nozzles

A device is required to distribute fuel flow to the afterburner main fuel nozzles.

Once the maximum afterburner fuel flow is scheduled, this controller ensures that the flow supplied to all nozzles is proportional to the flow number of each nozzle.

When sequentially activating each fuel manifold, the total fuel flow discharged from the nozzles should exhibit no significant variation, remain stable, and comply with the range specified in the agreed test specifications.

The **ring-sequencing valve** is controlled by the pilot’s throttle lever.

The sequencing characteristics are as follows:

- **Ring 1**: Always engaged
- **Ring 2**: Always engaged
- **Ring 3**: Engaged at **36% of maximum flow** (nominal value)
- **Ring 4**: Engaged at **71.6% of maximum flow** (nominal value)

An override function shall be provided to ensure that **Ring 3** and **Ring 4** do not engage until the exhaust nozzle reaches specified areas:
- **Ring 3**: **540 in²**
- **Ring 4**: **664 in²**

When \( \mathrm{P_3 / P_2 \geq 6.93} \), a readjustment device is required, reducing these areas by **42 in²**. The oil return port of the readjustment servo piston to the low-pressure return line closes when \( \mathrm{P_3 / P_2 \geq 6.93} \).

A device shall be provided to prevent afterburner fuel from reaching the nozzles when the engine speed is below a certain threshold, temporarily set at **80% of maximum engine speed**. This shall be capable of handling the emergency afterburner override engagement specified in Section 1.6. At **9% engine speed**, an external hydraulic connection is required to supply high-pressure fuel from the engine. This pressure signal shall be provided throughout all engine operating processes for afterburner engagement or disengagement. If required in the future, it may be configured to supply the pressure signal only during afterburner engagement.

When the afterburner is not engaged, cooling shall be provided to the afterburner fuel control unit and the ring-sequencing valve. For this purpose, fuel from the boost pump outlet shall be used for cooling when the afterburner is not engaged. The boost pump pressure rise can be determined from **Figure 5**.

---

### 8. Inlet Pressure Requirements

#### Maximum Temperature:
- **AVTAG**: **+60°C**
- **AVTUR/501**: **+85°C**

The maximum temperature corresponds to an afterburner fuel flow of **330 gallons/hour**. The fuel for the afterburner servo system shall be supplied from the engine main fuel pump, with the following maximum steady-state fuel temperatures:
- **+120°C** (AVTAG, AVTUR/501, AVCAT/48)

At the ring-sequencing valve, the afterburner fuel temperature shall be approximately:
- **+150°C**
- **+130°C**

---

### 11. Operation During Catapult Launch

# Introduction

The afterburner fuel combustion increases the back pressure of the low-pressure compressor and turbine, and variations in back pressure can cause abnormal engine operation. Therefore, a nozzle control system is added to restore the nozzle pressure to the value when the engine is not in afterburner mode, ensuring the core engine maintains normal operation. This allows the core engine to operate independently of the afterburner in use, and no adjustments to the core engine are required during afterburner fuel combustion. Since the exhaust area of the nozzle needs to be adjusted, this report describes the details of the current nozzle control system. While introducing the system design criteria, the report also provides fundamental knowledge on system selection. It includes design data demonstrating how system requirements are met and describes the working principles of the entire system.

### Selection of Nozzle Control System

To understand the selection of the existing nozzle control system, it is beneficial to first consider a simpler system for an engine with a lower pressure ratio and no bypass (such as an engine with a low-pressure ratio and no bypass system). The afterburner system of such an engine, even at maximum afterburner state, experiences few issues due to the relatively low combustion process temperature. Because fuel combustion is well below the stoichiometric point under all flight conditions, the relationship between afterburner temperature variation and the percentage change in afterburner fuel flow rate is essentially linear. Therefore, a choice can be made between planning fuel regulation as open-loop with nozzle sensing regulation as closed-loop, or another nozzle control as open-loop with the fuel system regulation as closed-loop. Theoretically, the latter system is preferred based on response speed. When the fuel system is closed-loop, it is easier to avoid large transient errors between afterburner fuel flow rate and nozzle area. Typically, the response speed of the afterburner fuel system can be designed to be faster, allowing the fuel system to keep up with the nozzle system's adjustments.

On the other hand, for systems requiring a high afterburner ratio, fuel combustion tends toward the stoichiometric point. Under these conditions, if a closed-loop fuel system is chosen, it can be observed that the same degree of afterburner ratio can be achieved just before or after the stoichiometric point. If the fuel-air ratio is applied after the stoichiometric point, the closed-loop fuel system will attempt to increase the fuel flow to correct the nozzle pressure. However, once past the stoichiometric point, the increased fuel will only push the combustion point further away from the stoichiometric point, resulting in a cooling jet that reduces nozzle pressure, prompting the control system to deliver even more fuel to the nozzles. This system is unstable and will deviate until a rich blowout occurs.

Thus, the choice between fuel regulation and nozzle sensing control becomes quite deliberative. Since the afterburner region of a straight-flow engine is between two choked nozzles, the afterburner fuel schedule can be established based on a single parameter (such as compressor outlet pressure) to achieve a constant afterburner fuel-air ratio. Other secondary factors (such as combustion efficiency) also need to be considered to obtain the final afterburner fuel schedule.

For high afterburner ratio engines, the selection of the afterburner control system leans more toward a scheduled fuel system and a signal-sensing nozzle. In fact, studying the operation of other alternative systems makes it clear why the above system must be chosen. For high afterburner ratio turbofan engines, fuel combustion needs to be near the stoichiometric point, but the difficulty lies in the fact that no single parameter can determine the air mass flow rate. This is because changes in the bypass ratio or \( \mathrm{T_1} \) cause changes in the air mass flow rate in the bypass duct without affecting the core engine's dimensionless mass flow rate. According to the above reasoning, as the bypass ratio deviates from the design state, the scheduled nozzle position requires fuel to flow through a sensing system that may suddenly lose control. If a system is designed to consider the bypass ratio for scheduling the nozzle, the system becomes complex and may produce interactions that make the system unstable. Therefore, a system must be designed that can schedule fuel while considering changes in the bypass ratio and maintain combustion near the stoichiometric point. Additionally, a signal-sensing nozzle system is used to keep the nozzle pressure at a level that prevents surge.

In pure jet engines, the primary purpose of nozzle control is to prevent changes in turbine back pressure, thereby maintaining the core engine in its design state. In turbofan engines, when the bypass flow is at a relatively low-pressure ratio, the engine's afterburner region no longer operates between critical nozzles, making nozzle control more critical. Because even small changes in nozzle pressure can affect bypass flow efficiency, not too large an error can cause the bypass flow to stop or even reverse, leading to surge. The nozzle control system must be designed so that the nozzle response time is fast enough to track the fastest commands from the fuel system and respond quickly to pressure errors in the nozzle to avoid surge.

Since a signal-sensing nozzle control system is chosen, the method of actuation to achieve control must be selected. The factors influencing this choice are briefly discussed below. As mentioned above, transient errors in nozzle pressure and nozzle position should be as small as possible to avoid surge. To achieve this, the actuation speed for opening and closing the nozzle needs to be as fast as possible. To reduce the system's volume and weight, the actuation components must be compact.

Keeping these factors in mind, four options are available: mechanical screw actuators, and hydraulic actuators using air, fuel, or oil as the medium. Among these four options, screw actuators and air actuators may not be adopted due to high cost, inconvenience in use, and slow operation. Of the remaining two, fuel actuators have the advantage of an available high-pressure system. Oil actuators, however, require a separate oil tank and pressurization system. Fuel actuators also have some disadvantages; during large flow rate, short-duration transients, they can cause a series of interactions with the fuel system due to changes in fuel flow. Using a fuel actuation system also increases the fire hazard to some extent. Under flight conditions, the system pressure is the fuel pressure, and at high altitudes, the reduction in fuel pressure can severely affect response speed. Considering these factors, the best system is a separate closed system using oil as the working medium. The system components include a nozzle boost oil tank, main oil pump and scavenge pump, nozzle oil heat exchanger, dump valve, and six hydraulic actuators. The sensing signal is provided by the pressure ratio regulator. Of the two pumps, the low-pressure pump is a gear pump, and the high-pressure pump (main nozzle oil pump) is a positive displacement piston pump. The nozzle oil pump size must ensure that enough oil is delivered to the actuators for rapid nozzle movement. The oil tank should store enough oil for this operation and compensate for any potential leaks. The nozzle oil tank is pressurized to maintain adequate inlet pressure for the low-pressure pump. Pressurization is achieved by bleeding air from the compressor's seventh stage to the oil tank, with the size of the restrictor for this purpose detailed in TDR4159.

## Operation of the Nozzle System

For the purposes of this section, the pressure ratio regulator is treated as a device that interacts with the nozzle system but is not described in detail. Thus, the technical requirements of the nozzle system for the pressure ratio regulator are determined. The next section will explain how the pressure ratio regulator meets these technical requirements and its other functions.

During non-afterburning operation, when the engine speed is above \(80\% \mathrm{N_H}\), the nozzle area is required to maintain a reasonably fixed area. To make the engine easier to control at low speeds, a larger readjusted base nozzle area is needed when the speed is below \(80\% \mathrm{N_H}\). The design characteristics of the nozzle itself (see TDR782) cause the pressure inside the nozzle to tend to open the nozzle, so the nozzle control system must resist this movement. To this end, the pressure ratio regulator fixes the nozzle oil pump at a \(4 \frac{1}{2}^\circ\) stroke position. If left unchecked, the high-pressure oil pressure would increase until it exceeds the relief valve's discharge pressure, keeping the nozzle tightly against the nozzle actuator stop. Since there is an undesired high nozzle oil pressure, excess heat is generated in the nozzle oil pump, necessitating a dump valve. The mechanical linkage of the dump valve is struck by an adjustable stop on the nozzle actuator ring housing. When the nozzle closes further, the dump valve's spool is moved, diverting high-pressure oil to the low-pressure oil, eliminating high pressure in the actuator. Thus, the nozzle closes to a given area. A reset valve connected to the mechanical linkage is spring-loaded to maintain its position below \(80\% \mathrm{N_H}\), with the piston sensing low-pressure fuel on both sides. This benefits the lever striking the adjustable stop, causing the dump valve to operate earlier and maintain a larger nozzle area. When passing the \(80\% \mathrm{N_H}\) speed limit, the afterburner system's \(80\%\) speed switch schedules a servo oil flow into one side of the reset valve piston, counteracting the spring's action. The movement opposite to the spring force returns the lever, allowing the nozzle to close beyond the area corresponding to \(80\% \mathrm{N_H}\) before the dump valve acts again.

The effect of a larger nozzle area below \(80\% \mathrm{N_H}\) is to lower the low-pressure operating line. At minimum nozzle area, the nozzle petal angle itself is steeper, which is beneficial. Although the petals themselves are short, they allow for a larger area change between the maximum and minimum nozzle areas. As a result, the flow coefficient at minimum nozzle area and low nozzle pressure ratio is very low. A low flow coefficient tends to increase the back pressure of the low-pressure system, producing a condition similar to that previously described. As the nozzle pressure increases, low-pressure surge may occur. This surge is most likely to occur when operating the engine in the low flow coefficient region. Opening the nozzle area reduces the nozzle pressure, improves the flow coefficient, and moves the low-pressure operating line away from the surge line, making the engine easier to control.

Additionally, lowering the low-pressure operating line when engaging the afterburner is effective. When the afterburner ignites, a pressure surge occurs inside the nozzle, and the operating line must be lowered in advance. This lowering is also achieved by the afterburner reset valve and the nozzle dump valve with mechanical linkage. When the afterburner is engaged, a high-pressure fuel servo signal triggered by the pilot's throttle lever is sent to the spring side of the reset valve chamber. Thus, the engine's high-pressure fuel balances on both sides of the reset valve. Under spring force, the reset piston moves to the pre-open position. This movement is transmitted through the mechanical linkage, and since the dump valve lever is tightly against the nozzle stop position when controlling the nozzle position, the reset valve's movement is directly transmitted to the dump valve. The dump valve's movement opens the high-pressure oil return port, allowing the nozzle to open under the nozzle load. When the lever quickly reaches the nozzle stop position, the lever stops moving. During the entire afterburning period, the reset valve and dump valve remain in this position. At this point, the dump valve stops releasing oil, and the nozzle control is taken over by the pressure ratio regulator. When disengaging the afterburner, the servo signal from the pilot's throttle selection lever to the reset valve is canceled, and the reset valve returns to its position above \(80\% \mathrm{N_H}\) (the afterburner requires the pilot's throttle selection valve and the \(80\% \mathrm{N_H}\) synchronization valve to engage the signal).

When the afterburner ignites, the nozzle control system is required to operate as a closed-loop signal-sensing system. This requires canceling the interlock in the pressure ratio regulator and using the pressure ratio regulator to control the swashplate angle of the nozzle oil pump. When the afterburner ignites, a larger nozzle area is required, so the nozzle stop disengages from the dump valve lever, rendering the dump valve inoperative and no longer controlling the nozzle position until the afterburner is disengaged.

If leakage is ignored, the actuator system and nozzle oil pump can be considered as an integrator. Therefore, under stable afterburning conditions, the pump's swashplate angle should be at zero degrees, just maintaining the existing pressure in the actuator. When the signal-sensing system's signal requires a change in nozzle position, the pump's swashplate angle changes to a positive or negative angle (closing or opening the nozzle). While the nozzle is moving as required, the pressure inside the nozzle is also changing, and the signal from the sensing device is changing. Ideally, the swashplate returns to the zero-degree position, and the nozzle just reaches the required position. Although there is some uncertainty in the nozzle position due to leakage flow in the actuator, this is the principle in theory. In practice, a leakage path is designed in each of the six actuators. The idea is that the actuators are located in the high-temperature area of the engine, especially during afterburner ignition, and leakage acts as a cooling flow. As such, the pump should always be working to maintain pressure balance between the actuator and the nozzle load. For this purpose, the swashplate is often at a small positive angle in steady state. Based on this action, the technical requirement for the pressure ratio regulator is that the input signal to the pump should have a zero position to adjust the oil pump when the system is unbalanced, so the system stabilizes (i.e., the swashplate angle is just at the position to compensate for leakage).

The technical requirement of the nozzle system for the pressure ratio regulator is that during non-afterburning operation, the pressure ratio regulator should be interlocked in the middle position to obtain a \(4 \frac{1}{2}^\circ\) swashplate angle, keeping the dump valve in the nozzle position. During afterburning operation, the pressure ratio regulator should provide a signal to the pump to correct nozzle position errors. Since the oil pump acts as an integrator, the signal from the pressure ratio regulator needs to be in the form of an error signal.

### Pressure Ratio Regulator

As mentioned above, the pressure ratio regulator is a signal-sensing device that provides the required signal to the nozzle system. The pressure ratio regulator also sends a signal to the \( \mathrm{P_3 / P_2} \) control air signal generator to determine the afterburner fuel flow rate. As described in TDR7788, the \( \mathrm{P_3 / P_2} \) control air signal generator compensates for the effect of the bypass ratio. Since it is an adjustable voltage divider system, its voltage division characteristics can be fully realized by the needle valve shaping inside the generator. The pressure ratio regulator is required to provide a linear change of \( \mathrm{P_3 / P_2} \) with position to facilitate needle valve shaping in the generator. To reduce friction in the pressure ratio regulator, the usual practice is to use a pressure-direct-acting and rotating spool valve. A piston with equal areas on both sides senses \( \mathrm{P_2} \) on one side and balances it with the divided pressure \( \mathrm{P_3} \) on the other side. The \( \mathrm{P_3} \) divided pressure is obtained by releasing \( \mathrm{P_3} \) pressure through a fixed orifice and a variable orifice to \( \mathrm{P_0} \). The variable orifice is adjusted by a needle valve attached to the piston. The piston moves until the \( \mathrm{P_3} \) divided pressure equals \( \mathrm{P_2} \). Since both \( \mathrm{P_3 / P_2} \) and \( \mathrm{P_2 / P_0} \) are supercritical, the \( \mathrm{P_3 / P_2} \) orifice diameter is constant, and the following equation holds when air flows through the orifice:

\[
\frac{M \sqrt{T_3}}{P_3 A} = \text{constant}
\]

## Section 78 (Pages 386-390)

Here is the complete English translation of the provided Chinese technical document on the Spey MK202 aircraft engine:

---

$$
\frac{M_{1} \sqrt{T_{1}}}{A_{1} P_{3}} = \frac{M_{2} \sqrt{T_{2}}}{A_{2} P_{2}}
$$

Where subscript 1 denotes the fixed orifice for \( P_{3}/P_{2} \), and subscript 2 denotes the variable orifice for \( P_{2}/P_{0} \).

When there is no cavitation or air source within the system, \( M_{1} = M_{2} \), and the flow is considered adiabatic, thus \( T_{1} \equiv T_{2} \). The equation then simplifies to:

$$
\frac{1}{A_{1} P_{3}} = \frac{1}{A_{2} P_{2}}
$$

$$
\frac{P_{3}}{P_{2}} = \frac{A_{2}}{A_{1}}
$$

or

$$
A_{2} = A_{1} \frac{P_{3}}{P_{2}}
$$

In simple terms, the area of the variable orifice equals the area of the fixed orifice multiplied by the high-pressure compressor pressure ratio (\( P_{3}/P_{2} \)). If the outer orifice area remains constant and the needle valve moves axially, then with the correct needle valve profile, the annular area of the variable orifice changes linearly with the axial displacement of the needle valve. This is how it is implemented in practice.

The nominal stroke of the needle valve is selected, along with the size of the outer orifice used, so that the stroke has a linear relationship with the variable orifice area. The stroke provides a calibration effect, and the area occupied by the needle valve can be calculated by the following formula:

Needle valve area \(\approx\) Total orifice area – Required orifice area

Thus, the needle valve diameter at a given stroke can be determined, and consequently, the precise needle valve profile can be established.

The piston or needle valve stroke signal is transmitted via a linkage mechanism, which is essentially linear, to the \( P_{3}/P_{2} \)-controlled air signal generator. This device receives the signal and provides the required signal for the afterburner. The precise pressure-dividing characteristics obtained from the needle valve profile provided by the manufacturer. The \( P_{3}/P_{2} \) signal is also used in the exhaust nozzle control system, as explained below:

Another function of the aforementioned pressure ratio regulator is to adjust the exhaust nozzle area during afterburner operation. As previously mentioned, since the exhaust nozzle hydraulic pump acts as an integrator in the system, an error signal is required. A reference signal \( P_{8} \) is generated and compared with the actual nozzle pressure \( P_{6} \). Additionally, direct-acting pressure is used to balance the reference pressure \( P_{8} \) and the actual pressure \( P_{8} \) on both sides of the rotating piston. As mentioned earlier, the use of a rotating piston prevents static friction and hysteresis effects that would occur with a stationary piston. Similar to the \( P_{3}/P_{2} \) piston, this piston positions the needle valve within the orifice connected to \( P_{0} \). In steady-state conditions, the upstream pressure of this orifice is \( P_{8} \), and the needle valve is required to be in a set position—a null position—otherwise, the nozzle hydraulic pump will move the exhaust nozzle until the null position is reached. To achieve this, \( P_{3} \) air flows through another variable orifice into this piston. Since the \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) needle valve requires a fixed setting in steady-state, the orifice area remains constant, and thus fixed in steady-state. When using subscripts 3 and 4 to represent the orifices between \( P_{8} \) and \( P_{8} \), and between \( P_{8} \) and \( P_{0} \) respectively, the air mass flow equation for choked flow through the orifice is:

$$
\frac{\Delta M_{3} \sqrt{T_{3}}}{\Delta A_{3} P_{3}} = \frac{\Delta M_{4} \sqrt{T_{4}}}{\Delta A_{4} P_{6}}
$$

However, the air mass flow is continuous, and this flow is considered adiabatic, thus:

$$
\frac{1}{A_{3} P_{3}} = \frac{1}{A_{4} P_{6}}
$$

or

$$
\frac{1}{A_{3}} = \frac{P_{3}}{A_{4} P_{6}}
$$

Thus, in steady-state, \( A_{4} \) is constant, and therefore the area \( A_{3} \) is determined by the above equation. If the \( P_{3}/P \) signal relationship is already established, then the needle valve system is designed similarly to the \( P_{3}/P_{2} \) needle valve to provide this relationship. With the \( P_{3}/P_{2} \) generator already in place, there is a single-valued relationship between \( P_{3}/P_{2} \) and \( P_{3}/P_{6} \), so the \( P_{3}/P_{2} \) output can be used to move the trim needle valve, adjusting the \( P_{8} \) flow to the piston. As long as the \( P_{3} \) trim needle valve profile incorporates the \( P_{3}/P_{2} \) and \( P_{3}/P_{8} \) relationships, this is feasible. In fact, two trim needle valves are used, each for different flight conditions. When boundary layer control is applied, the engine's operating line changes, thereby altering the \( P_{3}/P_{2} \) to \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) relationship. Therefore, one needle valve is used for normal operation, and another is used when boundary layer control is applied. The selection of which needle valve to use at any given time is achieved by a boundary layer control sensor that signals the boundary layer control switching valve. This is described in TDR7790.

During transient operation, such as when afterburner is engaged from steady flight, the pressure ratio regulator functions as follows: The \( P_{3}/P_{2} \) needle valve establishes the afterburner fuel flow signal and sets the position of the \( P_{3} \) trim needle valve, depending on whether boundary layer control is used. At this point, a defined orifice diameter is obtained. When the reference \( P_{6} \) does not equal the actual \( P_{8} \), the piston moves to change the orifice size and align the reference \( P_{8} \) with the actual \( P_{6} \). This movement is transmitted to the exhaust nozzle hydraulic pump, thereby changing the pump stroke and causing the actuator to move. When \( P_{8} \) is restored, the pressure error on the piston decreases, and the piston moves back toward its null position. The speed at which the null position is reached can be adjusted by the \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) needle valve profile attached to the piston. A needle valve with a small taper requires a large displacement to balance the forces on the piston, making it easy for the pump to increase its stroke and provide a large flow to the actuator, resulting in a rapid response. However, in this case, the system is highly sensitive and prone to instability. Conversely, a needle valve with a large taper is very stable but responds slowly to exhaust nozzle movement. This necessitates the calibration of multiple needle valves with different profiles to adjust the system's effective gain. The existing needle valve profile is a compromise between these two requirements (see TDR7782). The control section of the needle valve has a large taper, resulting in slow exhaust nozzle movement and stable regulation. The system's null position is also in this large taper section, providing excellent stability. The rest of the needle valve profile consists of two parts: a cylindrical section in the opening direction to achieve virtually infinite gain, and a small taper section in the closing direction to provide very high gain. Thus, the system responds rapidly to large disturbances.

When large changes in exhaust nozzle position are required, initially, in steady-state, the needle valve regulates the exhaust nozzle at the needle valve null position (i.e., the designed taper section). When the piston pressure ratio changes, the piston moves to balance the acting forces. For small pressure differences, the needle valve still regulates the nozzle within the taper section. However, for large changes in nozzle position considered here, the needle valve moves out of the taper section into a high-gain section. At this point, the pressure difference encounters no resistance, so depending on the required direction of nozzle movement, the piston moves the exhaust nozzle hydraulic pump to maximum or minimum stroke, providing rapid nozzle movement. As the nozzle moves, the piston pressure begins to recover, and the piston starts to move back toward its control position. This slows down the oil supply rate of the hydraulic pump, but the needle valve remains in its high-gain section, so it quickly returns to the taper section until the piston pressure is balanced. The return movement's endpoint is a slow return to the null position. Detailed descriptions of early needle valve profile designs can be found in TDR779. The calculation methods therein serve only as a guide, as some profiles have been modified during the adjustment of response speed and stability factors (see TDR7782).

Another factor to consider is performance under \( 6g \) loads. The afterburner system and exhaust nozzle control system must operate reliably under various flight conditions. The most extreme scenario is catapult takeoff under afterburner conditions. During catapulting, the engine experiences short-term \( 6g \) loads. A balanced piston may move under \( 6g \) loads, altering the regulation parameters. Further design work has been done to mitigate these load effects. A typical example is described in TDR7107, which considers engine performance compensation for these accelerations.

During non-afterburning operation, the pressure ratio regulator keeps the exhaust nozzle hydraulic pump operating at a fixed stroke. This is achieved by attaching a clutch to the needle valve position. In non-afterburning mode, the clutch engages, keeping the pressure ratio regulator needle valve in the required fixed position. When afterburner is engaged, a servo signal from the low-pressure shutdown switch is sent to the pressure ratio regulator. This signal opposes the pressure load that keeps the clutch engaged. The servo signal disengages the clutch, allowing the pressure ratio regulator to operate. The needle valve is positioned to close the exhaust nozzle, which has been pre-opened by the retracting valve schedule. The pump then moves to full positive stroke, maintaining the retracting valve operation until afterburner ignition and \( P_{6} \) rise. As \( P_{6} \) rises, the pressure ratio regulator senses \( P_{8} \), causing the exhaust nozzle to open beyond the retracting valve lever's range. At this point, the retracting valve ceases operation, and the pressure ratio regulator takes over exhaust nozzle control.

When afterburner is disengaged, the servo signal does not pass through the low-pressure switch, so the pressure on the clutch mechanism piston re-engages the clutch. This fixes the position of the needle valve in the pressure ratio regulator as before, resuming normal non-afterburning operation.

### Abstract

This report estimates and provides the needle valve profile for the Spey MK202 afterburner exhaust nozzle servo system. A transfer function for small changes in afterburner level has been derived, and the response to step changes in afterburner level for several flight conditions has been estimated.

Additionally, the effects of exhaust nozzle trim needle valve tolerances and hydraulic pump swashplate angle errors on the low-pressure compressor (LPC) working line have been evaluated.

### Introduction

To control the engine according to the two operating lines shown in Figure 4 for flight conditions with and without boundary layer control (BLC) bleed, an exhaust nozzle control system is required. A closed-loop control system maintains the engine's operation along the appropriate schedule. The closed-loop system senses errors in the expected turbine pressure ratio \( P_{3}/P_{9} \) and adjusts the exhaust nozzle area to correct this error until the correct \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) value is achieved.

The \( P_{3}/P_{2} \) piston in the pressure ratio regulator generates a displacement proportional to \( P_{3}/P_{2} \), and thus to the non-dimensional speed \( N/\sqrt{T_{1}} \). The reference required for the exhaust nozzle control schedule is provided by the trim needle valve and the \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) piston's needle valve in series. The trim needle valve is connected via a linkage to the \( P_{3}/P_{2} \) piston, so its position is a function of \( N/\sqrt{T_{1}} \). The trim needle valve reduces \( P_{3} \) pressure to \( P_{6} \), maintaining the \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) piston in equilibrium. An error in the \( P_{3}/P_{8} \) pressure ratio produces a displacement of the \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) piston, which adjusts the exhaust nozzle area to return the \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) piston to its equilibrium position.

The \( P_{3}/P_{8} \) piston needle valve profile is determined by the gain required by the control system, balancing rapid response and system stability.

### Application Data and Performance

#### Performance Data

Basic performance data are shown in Figures 1–3.

#### Partial Derivatives and Time Constants of Engine Parameters

The partial derivatives and time constants of engine parameters used to estimate the stability and response speed of the entire engine system are listed in the coefficient table on page 384.

#### Design Requirements and Constants for the Device

The exhaust nozzle is required to move from the fully closed to the fully open position in 1.2 seconds. To meet this requirement, the actuator piston dimensions are set to a high-pressure total area of 13.77 in² and a low-pressure total area of 15.26 in². At a maximum pressure of 3300 psi, the required exhaust nozzle hydraulic pump capacity is 937 gallons/hour free flow.

Constants for the pressure ratio regulator include:

- Piston area \( A_{1} = 2.06 \) in²
- Steady-state volume = 2.34 in³
- Total piston displacement = 0.625 in

The requirements for the two exhaust nozzle control schedules are shown in Figures 4 and 5.

In estimating the response, seven flight conditions were considered, and the constants for the transfer function are provided in the coefficient table on page 384:

1. Sea level, Mach 0.745, hot day, maximum afterburner
2. 61,087 ft, Mach 2.814, cold day, maximum afterburner
3. Sea level, static, ISA, maximum afterburner
4. 50,000 ft, Mach 0.528, cold day, maximum afterburner
5. 2,000 ft, Mach 0.387, cold day, maximum afterburner
6. Sea level, Mach 0.745, hot day, 15% afterburner
7. Sea level, Mach 1.209, cold day, 15% afterburner

The flow coefficients for the upstream fixed orifice and downstream variable orifice of the \( P_{3}/P_{2} \) servo actuator are specified as follows:

- Upstream orifice \( C_{D} = 0.75 \)
- Downstream orifice \( C_{D} = 0.90 \)

For the \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) servo actuator, bench test data are available. For the \( P_{3}/P_{8} \) orifice at minimum area:

- \( P_{3}/P_{8} \) orifice at maximum area:

It is assumed that the two \( C_{D} \) values vary linearly between the limit positions.

#### Assumptions

- The response of the engine's main fuel system and afterburner fuel system is faster than that of the exhaust nozzle system.
- Within the afterburner range, the high-pressure rotor speed does not change with throttle lever movement. This assumption has been validated by previous experience with other engines. For example, a 7.5% change in net thrust results in only a 0.024% change in high-pressure rotor speed.
- The inertia and friction forces of the pressure ratio regulator's actuating piston are neglected.
- For small changes, the transfer function of the pressure ratio device's hydraulic amplifier is taken as 1, and the filling lag and acoustic lag of the \( P_{2} \), \( P_{3} \), and \( P_{6} \) pipes in the pressure ratio device are neglected.
- The pressure losses from the engine connectors to the pressure ratio device are taken from TDR3938. For all flight conditions, the following ratios of pressure ratio device pressure to engine total pressure are used:

$$
P_{2}'/P_{2} = 1.0; \quad P_{3}'/P_{3} = 0.946; \quad P_{6}'/P_{6} = 1.024
$$

### Results

The required profiles for the \( P_{3}/P_{2} \) servo actuator, \( P_{3}/P_{8} \) servo piston, and the two \( P_{3}/P_{2} \) trim needle valves are shown in Figures 1–3.

Two \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) needle valve profile values were studied. The first caused a \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) ratio error resulting in a maximum piston stroke error of ±0.02. Under the seven flight conditions mentioned above, the effect of a 10% step change in afterburner level on various parameters using this \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) needle valve profile is shown by the solid lines in Figures 6, 7, and 8. The second \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) needle valve profile was designed to produce the same \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) error as commonly used in similar pressure ratio devices, with a maximum stroke error of ±0.32. Under the same flight conditions and the same afterburner step change, the effects on engine parameters are shown by the dash-dot lines in Figures 6, 7, and 8. It can be seen that the second needle valve profile (dash-dot lines) provides a slower response than the first (solid lines) but with no overshoot. Moreover, considering that the disturbance level measured with the first needle valve profile's \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) pressure ratio piston is comparable to the error producing the maximum piston position, i.e., ±0.02, and the piston easily oscillates, it is recommended to use the second \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) needle valve profile, which is shown in Figure 2 and estimated under these conditions.

The effect of \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) trim needle valve profile tolerances on the engine's low-pressure compressor (LPC) working line was studied. Due to the fact that two different operating lines are required in the afterburner region without boundary layer control, the \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) trim needle valve without BLC has two different bend segments (corresponding to \( P_{3}/P_{2} = 6.40 \) and 7.245 in Figure 4). This means the pressure ratio device can be precisely adjusted at one point on the needle valve profile, while other points on the profile are only accurate within the needle valve diameter tolerance limits. From a manufacturing perspective, the minimum allowable diameter error is 0.0006. Due to inaccuracies in the needle valve profile, lowering the working line is preferable to raising it. Therefore, the effect of positive (i.e., manufacturing) tolerances was estimated. This situation is represented in Figure 9 as the effect on the LPC working line. Below an inlet mass flow function of 170, no difference is observed between the correct and incorrect working lines. Even at the worst point, the effect of tolerance on the working line is reflected in a pressure ratio change of only 0.06, which is considered acceptable.

Similarly, the effect of exhaust nozzle hydraulic pump swashplate angle error on the LPC working line was studied. The required characteristic of the negative ratio orifice is to enable the nozzle hydraulic pump to operate normally under the following conditions: in steady-state operation, with oil temperatures from 0°C to 150°C, swashplate accuracy of ±0.5°, and actuator total load between 1500 lb and 12,075 lb. Using the characteristics of the pump and negative ratio orifice combination system, the actual maximum swashplate error obtained within the specified limits is -0.16°. However, at maximum nozzle load (30,746 lb at 31,546 ft, Mach 2.146, afterburner off—see TDR782), the swashplate error reaches -0.6°. This causes a -0.015 in stroke error in the \( P_{3}/P_{6} \) piston, which is equivalent to raising the working line by less than one-third of the shift caused by needle valve profile tolerances, and this is acceptable.

### Appendix

#### Transfer Functions of a Twin-Spool Engine with Afterburner and Variable Area Nozzle

##### 1. Transfer Function of the Main Engine

1) High-Pressure Rotor Speed

\[
\Delta N_H = \frac{K_{14}}{1 + T_H D} \Delta N_L + \frac{K_{15}}{1 + T_H D} \Delta F_E + \frac{K_{16}}{1 + T_H D} \Delta F_R + \frac{K_{17}}{1 + T_H D} \Delta A_N
\]

Where:

\[
K_{14} = \left( \frac{\partial Q_H}{\partial N_L} \right) \times \left( \frac{\partial N_H}{\partial Q_H} \right)
\]

(For small changes at any given condition, the partial derivatives are assumed constant).

And \( T_H = -\Delta I_H / (\partial Q_H / \partial N_H) \)

Similarly, the equation for the low-pressure rotor speed can be derived:

2) \(\Delta N_L = \frac{K_{18}}{1 + T_L D} \Delta N_H + \frac{K_{19}}{1 + T_L D} \Delta F_E + \frac{K_{20}}{1 + T_L D} \Delta F_R + \frac{K_{21}}{1 + T_L D} \Delta A_N + K_{22} \Delta A_{NL} \)

For dependent variables such as \( P_2 \), the following can be obtained:

\[
\Delta P_2 = K_{22} \Delta N_L + K_{23} \Delta N_H + K_{24} \Delta F_E + K_{25} \Delta F_R + K_{26} \Delta A_N
\]

##### 2. Transfer Function of the Afterburner Fuel System

\[
\Delta F_R = \frac{K_b \Delta \beta + K_f \Delta N_H + K_g \Delta P_\beta}{1 + \frac{2 \xi}{\omega} D + \frac{1}{\omega^2} D^2} + \frac{K_h \Delta P_\beta + K_s (1 + \lambda_1 D) \Delta P_\beta}{\left(1 + \frac{2 \xi}{\omega} D + \frac{1}{\omega^2} D^2 \right)(1 + \lambda_2 D)}
\]

##### 3. Transfer Function of the Nozzle Control System

\[
\Delta A_N = \frac{K_{10} \Delta P_2 + K_{12} \Delta P_3 + K_{13} \Delta P_6}{D (1 + \lambda_2 D)}
\]

Using the assumptions given in this report, the equation becomes:

\[
K_{14} \Delta N_L + K_{15} \Delta F_E + K_{16} \Delta F_R + K_{17} \Delta A_N = 0
\]

\[
\Delta N_L + T_L D \Delta N_L - K_{19} \Delta F_E - K_{20} \Delta F_R - K_{21} \Delta A_N = 0
\]

\[
K_{22} \Delta N_L - K_{24} \Delta F_E - K_{25} \Delta F_R - K_{26} \Delta A_N = 0
\]

\[
\Delta P_6 - K_{32} \Delta N_L - K_{34} \Delta F_E - K_{35} \Delta F_R - K_{36} \Delta A_N = 0
\]

\[
\Delta F_R - K_6 \Delta P_2 - K_8 \Delta P_3 - K_9 \Delta P_6 = K_5 \Delta \beta
\]

\[
D \Delta A_N + \lambda_2 D^2 \Delta A_N - K_{10} \Delta P_2 - K_{12} \Delta P_3 - K_{13} \Delta P_6 = 0
\]

The coefficients for various engine and flight conditions, as well as the time constants for the engine and nozzle systems, are listed in the coefficient table on page 384. By solving the system of equations, the overall transfer functions for parameters \(\Delta N_L\), \(\Delta A_N\), \(\Delta F_E\), \(\Delta F_R\), \(\Delta P_2\), \(\Delta P_3\), and \(\Delta P_6\) with respect to changes in throttle lever angle \(\Delta \beta\) are obtained.

The effects of a step change in throttle lever angle on various engine parameters have been determined. Examples of these changes are shown in Figures 6, 7, and 8.

### **Purpose**
This report specifies the **minimum size of the restrictor orifice** installed in the **7th-stage air pipeline** for pressurizing the **tail nozzle oil tank**. The restrictor orifice has a diameter of **0.025 inches** and requires filtration.

A **0.031-inch diameter restrictor** provides satisfactory oil tank pressure.

---

### **1. Introduction**
It is desirable for the **tail nozzle hydraulic oil tank pressure** to be maintained at approximately **8 psi above ambient pressure**. However, measured oil tank pressure was found to be **excessively high**.

In **high engine pressure ratio flight conditions**, even after accounting for **pressure losses in the pressurization valve system and pipeline**, the supplied air pressure remains too high, exceeding the required pressure by **7 psi**. Reducing the adjustment of the pressurization valve is not feasible because maintaining only **8 psi at sea level** would result in **insufficient pressure at high altitude**.

### Pressure

There are two possible approaches to address this issue:

1. Increase the flow area;
2. Reduce the airflow rate.

This report investigates approach (2), determining the minimum airflow required to replace the hydraulic fluid in the oil tank when the exhaust nozzle is opened at maximum speed.

## 2. Calculation

The maximum free flow rate of the oil pump is **937 gallons/hour**. Under this flow condition, when the exhaust nozzle is opened, the piston retracts from the actuator cylinder, and the flow from the oil tank compensates for the volume displaced by the piston rod retraction. The flow rate is calculated by the following formula:

or

At approximately **63,000 feet**, with **Mach number \( M_N = 0.88 \)** (International Standard Atmosphere), the minimum pressure occurs at the **7th stage of the high-pressure compressor (HPC)**. Under this condition:

- \( p_0 = 0.9 \) psi (absolute)
- \( P_{7\text{th stage}} = 12.9 \) psi (absolute)
- \( T_7 = 562 \, \text{K} \)

The required oil tank pressure should not exceed **8.9 psi (absolute)**.

\[
\frac{P_{7\text{th stage}}}{P_{\text{tank}}} = 1.45
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{M \sqrt{T}}{A P_{7\text{th stage}}} = 0.373
\]

Converting the mass flow rate to volumetric flow rate (related to the air density in the tank) yields **7.0 in/s**.

Assuming \( C_D = 0.7 \), the diameter of the orifice is:

\[
D = 0.025 \, \text{inches}
\]

### 3. Estimated Improvements

The current restrictor orifice diameter used on the engine is **0.041 inches**.

A restrictor orifice diameter of **0.031 inches** is more suitable than the minimum size of **0.025 inches**. The estimated pressure loss margins for each restrictor orifice size are as follows:

**Figure 1** in this report presents the pressure loss from the pressurizing valve to the outlet pipe outlet as a function of \( P_7^{\frac{4}{5}} \). This pressure loss is a function of the air mass flow rate because the restrictor orifice operates in a choked flow condition. For a fixed-size restrictor orifice, the air mass flow rate is proportional to the pressure \( P_{7\text{th stage}} \). Conversely, if \( P_{7\text{th stage}} \) remains constant, the air mass flow rate is proportional to the restrictor orifice area. Therefore, for a given \( P_7 = 5\sqrt{2} \) pressure, the effect of calibrating the restrictor orifice size can be inferred from **Figure 1** by calibrating \( P_7 = 4\sqrt{2} \) for a fixed restrictor orifice size.

The calibrated point on **Figure 1** corresponds to the maximum \( P_7 = 4\sqrt{2} \). The maximum \( P_7^* = 182 \) psi (absolute), with a corresponding pressure loss of **7.2 psi**.

| Restrictor Orifice Size (Diameter, inches) | 0.041 (Current) | 0.031 | 0.025 (Minimum) |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------|-----------------|
| Air Pressure Loss (psi)                    | 7.2             | 2.4   | 1.0             |
| Tank Pressure (psi, gauge) at Max \( P_7 \) with Valve Set per DC9402 and Figure 1 | 15.0            | 9.8   | 7.9             |

Using two identical restrictor orifices in series does not show significant advantages. Two **0.034-inch** restrictor orifices are equivalent to one **0.031-inch** orifice and still require filtration. Two **0.041-inch** restrictor orifices (without filtration) are equivalent to one **0.037-inch** orifice but result in an unacceptable tank pressure of **12.6 psi (gauge)**. To reduce the tank pressure to **2.4 psi (gauge)**, five **0.041-inch** restrictor orifices would need to be connected in series.

### Abstract

This report introduces a method to correct engine thrust loss during catapult takeoff (acceleration of **5g**) with **7th-stage boundary layer control (BLC) bleed**.

The use of a prototype **\( P_3 / P_2 \)** air piston with a **\( P_3 \)** trim needle valve, weighing **0.375 lb**, results in a **1.3% thrust loss** and a **1.77% increase** in exhaust nozzle effective area. The latest version, using a **0.6 lb \( P_3 / P_2 \)** piston, increases thrust by **0.3%** and reduces the exhaust nozzle effective area by **0.58%**, raising the engine operating line accordingly.

To achieve the best thrust variation, the mass of the **\( P_3 / P_2 \)** air piston should be increased by **48% (0.18 lb)**, which reduces the exhaust nozzle area by only **0.132%**.

**Note:** For accelerations other than **5g**, the percentage errors in thrust and exhaust nozzle area can be scaled proportionally.

\[
\frac{P_3'}{P_3} = 0.946; \quad \frac{P_6'}{P_6} = 1.024; \quad \frac{P_2'}{P_2} = 1.0
\]

- **\( A_g \)**: Exhaust nozzle effective area.
- **\( N_H \)**: High-pressure rotor speed, RPM.

## 2. Introduction

The effect of **g-loading** during catapult takeoff on the engine control system has been virtually eliminated through design modifications by Lucas.

However, **g-loading** affects the afterburner fuel control system and the exhaust nozzle pressure ratio piston, causing significant thrust errors. Without compensation at **5g**, the thrust error is **-1.3% \( X_N \)**.

The engine accessory specification states that during catapult takeoff, accelerations up to **5g** may occur, and the afterburner fuel system components must provide accurate engine thrust.

This report calculates the results for **5g** acceleration. For higher or lower **g** loads, thrust and exhaust nozzle area errors can be determined proportionally.

Previously, the effect of **g-loading** on the **\( P_3 / P_2 \)** trim needle valve of the afterburner fuel control device was neglected as a second-order effect.

In reality, this simplification is inappropriate because, with the original piston weight, a thrust gain of approximately **0.5%** occurs under **5g** acceleration.

This issue was studied, and the corrected mass of the **\( P_3 / P_2 \)** air piston assembly was calculated to correct the net thrust loss and operating line.

This raised the question of improving the pressure ratio regulator trim needle valve profile (with BLC engaged). The reason for modifying the profile is to reduce the possibility of afterburner surge when the **12th-stage BLC bleed** is engaged. It was also proposed to use a trim needle valve with a similar profile but shifted rearward relative to the reference surface to allow greater axial adjustment. The modified profile necessitates revisiting the **g-loading** issue described in this report.

## 3. Study

Key calculation results are as follows:

The supplier estimated the effect of **g-loading** on the main pressure differential regulator and fuel control spool valve, resulting in a thrust loss of **0.144%/g**.

Based on the needle valve calibration (with BLC engaged) and results from **TDR779 Figure 1** (**\( P_3 / P_2 \)** servo needle valve), a plot of **\( A_3 / A \)** versus **\( P / P_s \)** was created, as shown in **Figure 1** of this report.

**\( A_4 / A_1 \)** = constant (ignoring pressure ratio regulator load drift). This constant was calculated using the design operating line pressures for **\( A_{9G} = 378.5 \, \text{in}^2 \)**, **n = 0**, and **W = 1**. A curve of **W** versus **\( A_gG \)** was plotted for **n = 5g** (**Figure 2**). Additionally, a curve of **n = 5g**, **W** versus **% \( F_R \)** error was plotted (**Figure 3**). Using appropriate conversion factors, the final plot of total **% \( X_N \)** error versus **W** was obtained*.

## Results and Conclusions

The final plot shows that, under **g-loading**, the current piston mass results in engine thrust increasing due to the effects of BLC and the **\( P_3 / P_2 \)** trim needle valves. However, this thrust increase is insufficient to compensate for the thrust loss caused by **g-loading** on the **\( P_3 / P_2 \)** piston, so the overall **% \( X_N \)** error remains negative at **W = 1**. Therefore, to enhance the trim needle valve effect, the mass of the **\( P_3 / P_2 \)** piston must be increased.

![Figure 1](images/cc8789168369ed2fb3ed9c881035ff01012be461cce6275b5566ad7c57391b2d.jpg)
**Figure 1** Spey MK202 **\( P_3' / P_2' \)** vs. **\( A_3 / A_2 \)** Curve (Orifice Diameter: 0.156 inches)

Using the existing flow metering valve and main pressure differential regulator, the required **W** value to precisely restore thrust is **1.48**, which reduces the exhaust nozzle effective area by **1.32%**. To maintain the same exhaust nozzle effective area, the required **W** value is **1.45** (this reduces **\( X_N \)** by **0.1%** but maintains the engine's design operating line).

If a compensated afterburner fuel control device and main pressure differential regulator are used, a lighter weight is required to achieve zero thrust error, and the operating line is lowered, improving the surge margin (exhaust nozzle effective area increases by approximately **0.9%**).

The advantage of this method is that afterburner acceleration under **g-loading** is safer, and at high altitudes (where **g-forces** are smaller), operating line errors are less likely to occur. Since production devices lack balanced spool valves and main pressure differential controllers, this report still considers uncompensated operating lines.

Therefore, it is recommended that **W = 1.48** (maximum) to correct the **\( X_N \)** error, resulting in only a very small reduction in surge margin while increasing the exhaust nozzle effective area by **0.132%**.

This includes increasing the **\( P_3 / P_2 \)** piston mass to **0.555 lb (total weight)**, meaning the balance weight mass should be reduced from **0.218 lb** to **0.173 lb**.

| Spey MK202 Inlet Guide Vanes and Bleed Valve Control System |         |

**First Edition**
**12 October 1976**

# Abstract

This report specifies the various requirements for the inlet guide vanes and bleed valve control system. It also provides relevant design principles and references to reports that describe this design.

## Part 1 Introduction

The high-pressure compressor is equipped with variable-geometry inlet guide vanes to ensure that air enters the first-stage blades at the correct angle of attack, preventing stall at low speeds while maintaining the predetermined optimal angle of attack at high speeds.

The bleed valve system diverts a portion of the air from the seventh stage into the bypass duct via a manifold surrounding the compressor casing. At low compressor speeds, the bleed valve opens to prevent choking in the rear stages of the compressor.

This report outlines the requirements for the inlet guide vanes and bleed valve control system, provides the rationale for the selection of control parameters, and describes the relevant design principles. Some original technical reports discuss the work done during the early design phases and include applicable documents, thus gaining widespread use. The design principles of the current control device are based on those initially used in the Spey-type turbofan engine. Some technical reports related to engines in this scheme, intended to illustrate the original design concepts, are also included here.

## Part 2 System Requirements

The basic steady-state regulation schedule for the inlet guide vanes and bleed valve is as follows:

2.1 At low speeds, including engine start-up, the bleed valve is open, and the inlet guide vanes are in an increased angle of attack position.
2.2 As the high-pressure compressor speed increases, the bleed valve gradually closes and remains closed at high speeds. The angle of the inlet guide vanes gradually decreases with increasing speed and then remains at the optimal angle of attack position.
2.3 Sudden changes in compressor geometry are not permitted during speed increases or decreases, as this would cause corresponding changes in engine thrust, making aircraft control difficult.
2.4 The regulation schedule is selected based on the non-dimensional parameters of the high-pressure compressor to minimize deviations caused by a wide range of flight conditions.
2.5 Finally, the regulation schedule should ensure that the high-pressure compressor does not stall or surge within the normal operating range of the engine.
2.6 During transient processes, deviations from the steady-state schedule should be minimized to avoid compressor stall or surge. The goal is to maintain the inlet guide vane angle of attack deviation within \(5^\circ\). Considering the characteristics of maneuvering flight, the system should operate well when the inlet total temperature (\(T_1\)) changes at a rate of \(6^\circ C\)/second.

## Part 3 Design Principles

For the regulation parameters, the most suitable parameters are those directly related to changes in the high-pressure compressor geometry. The high-pressure compressor pressure ratio \(P_3/P_2\) and \(N_H/\sqrt{T_2}\) have been considered in detail as regulation parameters.

\(P_3/P_2\) did not provide satisfactory regulation characteristics because, during engine operation, the schedule obtained using the \(P_3/P_2\) parameter was higher than the steady-state schedule. The use of \(N_H/\sqrt{T_2}\) instead of \(P_3/P_2\) is described in Part 5 (TDR2638).

Regarding the parameter \(N_H/\sqrt{T_2}\), \(N_H\) is generally achieved through the action of centrifugal flyweights, which produce a force proportional to \(N_H^2\). This force is balanced against the spring force. If this mechanism is driven by an external (high-pressure) gearbox and lubricated, this mechanical method offers high reliability. The resultant motion is used to actuate a valve and schedule the power actuator's working medium.

Here, the choice between fuel or air arises. Since the high-pressure fuel pressure is approximately 3 to 4 times higher than the high-pressure compressor outlet pressure, using high-pressure fuel results in the smallest actuator cross-sectional area, thus minimizing size and weight. Moreover, high-pressure fuel is convenient to use as it can both burn and lubricate, avoiding the contact of lubricants with air inside the control device. Reference TDR794 provides details on the forces acting on the inlet guide vanes and bleed valve, as well as the load margins of the actuator.

Feedback for the power actuator is achieved through a linkage mechanism that changes the spring force. The extended mechanical linkage includes a bell crank. If the system's pivot point moves proportionally with temperature, then the function \(N_H^2/\text{temperature}\) can be obtained. The resultant motion controls the power actuator through a spool valve.

Although \(N_H\) is a suitable control coefficient, the high-pressure compressor inlet temperature \(T_2\) is not. This is because during engine operation, the rate of change of \(T_2\) is too high for existing temperature sensors to track. However, the parameter \(T_1\) changes only during aircraft maneuvering, up to \(6\%\)/second. Past experience has shown that \(N_H/\sqrt{T_1}\) is a suitable control parameter. Therefore, \(T_1\) is chosen instead of \(T_2\).

In all conditions (steady-state and transient), the goal is to keep the inlet guide vane angle of attack deviation within \(5^\circ\). The measurement system delay should be minimized as much as possible, which requires placing thermocouples along the axis of the Venturi tube with the thermocouple hot junction exactly at the throat of the Venturi tube. The airflow reaches a choked flow state over most of the engine speed range and is induced through the Venturi tube by an ejector. The highest available air pressure for the ejector is the high-pressure compressor outlet pressure \(P_3\), ensuring that the airflow velocity at the Venturi tube inlet is sonic.

To increase reliability, three sets of thermocouple elements in the thermocouple are connected in parallel, and the combined signal is fed to the amplifier.

The system includes a position feedback device and an electric actuator. This actuator changes the pivot position through a worm gear drive.

The function of the position feedback mechanism is to generate an electrical signal whose voltage is a function of angular displacement (pivot position). When fed to the amplifier, this signal balances the signal generated by the thermocouple, stopping the actuator motor. Thus, the system is designed so that the power actuator position has a single-valued relationship with \(N_H/\sqrt{T_1}\).

The position feedback device and electric actuator are designed to be compact and reliable, representing first-class patented products.

The design concept of the current inlet guide vane regulator initially used the approximate relationship \(N^2 \Omega^{-KT_1}\) as the control parameter. Such a regulator produced acceptable errors during subsonic engine operation, but performance was poorer during supersonic operation due to the wide operating range of \(T_1\). Therefore, a more precise method was adopted to regulate the power actuator position in relation to \(N^2/T_1\).

All electrical devices are cooled by fuel and, except for the amplifier, are housed within the regulator casing, thus avoiding additional sealing issues for these devices (except for the electrical connectors). The inlet guide vane control section in the amplifier is part of a larger amplifier used for engine fuel regulation.

# Purpose

This report describes all the work done on the system to date under the following headings:

(1) System Description
(2) Design Data
(3) Operating Loads and Pressures
(4) Dynamic Characteristics

### 1. System Description

Figure 1 shows the general schematic of the system.

The inlet guide vanes and bleed valve are driven by actuators powered by high-pressure engine fuel. The actuator position is made to have a single-valued relationship with \(N/\sqrt{T}\) through the following method: The actuator linkage is connected to the regulator linkage, which rotates a cam to lift one end of the feedback spring. The other end of the spring is acted upon by a component of the force generated by the governor rotating with the engine high-pressure shaft at a certain transmission ratio. The magnitude of this force is varied by a movable pivot that changes with \(T_1\), ensuring that the spring load equals \(KN^2/T_1\). One end of the spring is connected to the governor valve, which, depending on the direction of valve movement, directs high-pressure or low-pressure fuel to either side of the actuator piston. In steady-state conditions, the valve must be in or near the null position, and the cam lift has a linear relationship with the spring load. Therefore, the actuator position has a single-valued relationship with \(N^2/T_1\) as determined by the cam profile.

The movable pivot is driven by an electric actuator through a worm gear. A position sensor, connected to the worm gear via a Meyer base reference adjustment mechanism, produces a voltage proportional to the distance from the line of action of the spring force to the pivot. This voltage is compared with the input voltage from the \(T_1\) thermocouple. If there is a voltage error, the actuator moves to eliminate this error, ensuring that the distance from the spring force to the pivot is proportional to \(T_1\).

The control device assembly is adjusted using the Meyer base reference adjustment mechanism so that when \(T_1 = 0\), the distance between the spring and the movable pivot is zero.

If this is satisfied, adjusting the length of the external lever can eliminate any errors in the ratio \(N^2/T_1\) caused by manufacturing precision.

**Figure 1: Schematic Diagram of Inlet Guide Vanes (IGV) and Bleed Valve System**

### Estimation of Bernoulli Force
The theoretical Bernoulli force for a valve with a rectangular area and boss is 0.43AP, where *P* is the pressure differential and *A* is the area of one port.

This estimation has been adopted in the analysis.

## 3. Operating Loads and Pressures (Proposed Engine)

Operating loads are estimated from test results.

Due to the lack of extensive test sample data, the load should be multiplied by a scatter factor of 1.25. To account for friction between the load measurement point and the two joints on the actuator, an additional factor of 1.04 (μ = 0.2) is applied, resulting in a total load factor of 1.3.

Selecting reasonable values for the maximum bleed valve load and inlet guide vane load, and multiplying by the above factors, the actuator loads are derived as follows:

- Bleed valve: **8.5 P₂**
- Inlet guide vanes: **2.0 P₂**
- Total actuator load: **10.5 P₂**

Where **P₂** is the low-pressure compressor outlet pressure.

During deceleration, as engine fuel flow decreases, servo mechanism operating pressure drops, while aerodynamic loads resist actuator motion.

Under International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) sea-level static conditions, with a flight Mach number of 1.15 and a rapid deceleration to a speed where the bleed valve just opens, the system delay caused solely by the hydraulic system (excluding **T₁** actuator characteristics) is as follows:

| Parameter | Value (Static) | Value (M = 1.15) | Unit |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|------|
| Altitude  | 0               | 0                 | ft   |
| Mach Number (MN) | 0       | 1.15              |      |
| P₁        | 14.7            | 32.6              | psi  |
| NH        | 13,800          | 15,500            | rpm  |
| P₂ (deceleration) | 21     | 43                | psi  |
| High-pressure fuel pressure × 1.225 (actuator area) | 486 | 619 | lb |
| Low-pressure fuel pressure × 0.737 | 51 | 51 | lb |
| Actuator load | 220 | 450 | lb |
| dN/dt | 1500 | 3000 | rpm/s |
| Control valve displacement | 0.0010 | 0.0022 | in |
| Inlet guide vane delay | 0.6° | 0.8° | |

**Note:** The delay was obtained using a simple approximation method. It is assumed that the actuator moves at a constant speed under given conditions, and the system has sufficient time to approach steady-state error. With the control valve opening fixed, an actuator position error is obtained. Under the above flight conditions, the relationship between valve displacement and actuator diameter is shown in **Figure 2**. From the perspective of actuator load, the high **P₁** condition is the most severe. A slight increase in actuator load (e.g., when used in a new installation) would require a larger actuator to avoid excessive inlet guide vane delay. The curve illustrates how an oversized actuator can lead to excessive inlet guide vane delay, demonstrating that the current design is optimal.

## 4. Dynamic Characteristics

It has been found that compressibility, actuator inertia, actuator damping, and the rate of change of actuator load have negligible effects on the system's dynamic characteristics. Ignoring these factors, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\left[ \frac{m}{G} D^3 + \frac{K_1}{D} D^2 + \left( \frac{R_1}{K_3} + R_2 - R_3 \right) D + \frac{\partial R_1}{K_2 K_3} \right] h = c^*
\]

Where:
- **K₂ = 6.1** (determined by design, R = 0.002)
- **K₃ = 1.7** (T = 288K), **m = 0.002**
- **K₁ = 0.5 ~ 1.5** (determined by viscosity and tolerances)

**G ≈ 70√Pᵥ**, where **Pᵥ** is the steady-state valve pressure drop.

**R** – Bernoulli force ≈ **0.7 Pᵥ**

**R₃** – Effect of the rate of change of Bernoulli force with **Pᵥ**, which is minimal.

A typical set of data is:

| Load Condition | G  | R  | R  |
|----------------|----|----|----|
| Medium Load    | 900| 140| 12 |
| High Load      | 750| 70 | 6  |

**Figure 2: Optimization of Actuator Diameter**

### Stability Criterion

According to the Whiteley criterion, for a system with good quality (10% overshoot), the coefficients should be proportional to:

\[
D^3 + 2aD^2 + 2aD + a^3
\]

Applying the above data (scaling **D × 100**) and taking the lower damping value (**K₁ = 0.5**):

| Load Condition | System Coefficients | D³ | D² | D¹ | D⁰ |
|----------------|---------------------|----|----|----|----|
| Medium Load    | Actual Value        | 1  | 2.5| 6.2| 3.75|
|                | Whiteley Criterion  | 1  | 3.1| 4.8| 3.75|
| High Load      | Actual Value        | 1  | 2.5| 9.5| 4.5 |
|                | Whiteley Criterion  | 1  | 3.3| 5.5| 4.5 |

**Figure 4: Step Response Characteristics of a Third-Order System**

The system performs well under all conditions (see **Figure 4** for typical step response characteristics). However, if necessary, system quality can be improved by adjusting **R₁** (keeping **R₁/K₂** constant to maintain the same gain), thereby altering the third coefficient. This would require a new cam and spring on the regulator.

**First Edition**
**21 May 1962**

# Objective

This report describes the characteristics of a system controlling the bleed valve and inlet guide vanes based on pressure ratio, presents the reasons for rejecting this system, and recommends a system controlled by corrected speed.

# Introduction

The ideal characteristic for inlet guide vanes is that the angle should have a single-valued relationship with **N/√T** (see note on page 413).

The existing controller uses the approximation **N² - K T₁**, but current methods for measuring **T₁** have the disadvantage of slow response time. However, using dimensionless parameters avoids these issues. The compressor pressure ratio is commonly used for afterburner fuel and nozzle control. Therefore, it is proposed to use this signal for scheduling the inlet guide vanes and bleed valve.

This report presents the results of a study on this system, explains why it was ultimately abandoned, and recommends a system controlled by corrected speed.

## 1. General System Description

As shown in **Figure 1**, a sensing piston positioned by the pressure ratio drives a follow-up servo mechanism, which in turn drives a linkage system that operates the actuator controlling the inlet guide vanes and bleed valve.

![Figure 1](images/9659a0212ea61058c5a245da0e957a410e912724f0e63e11dc8c7d44cc2c3634.jpg)

## Section 84 (Pages 416-420)

Here is the complete English translation of the provided Chinese technical document about the Spey MK202 aircraft engine:

### Translation:

This diagram shows that if the inlet guide vane (IGV) angle is scheduled according to the pressure ratio, then regardless of whether during acceleration or deceleration, the resulting angle is higher than that required by the \(N/\sqrt{T}\) schedule.

This argument also applies to the bleed valve—during acceleration, it closes prematurely, and during deceleration, it opens prematurely.

Thus, we observe that if the servo mechanism and actuator have no time delay, and if the steady-state operation schedule is correct, during acceleration, there will be insufficient bleed and a positive inlet swirl angle, leading to compressor surge.

During deceleration, there is excessive bleed and a positive inlet swirl angle, but this is desirable.

What must be followed is that for steady-state operat

![Figure 2](images/17b008c9277323cc3d72eff5537bf48dc8623d5c96e5913607d583c5d0cc4e7b.jpg)
**Figure 2**

ion, at least in the high-speed range of variable geometry, this schedule should be corrected. Because the engine operates in this range during high-speed cruise.

## Reducing Lead

This error can be reduced through a follow-up servo mechanism with an appropriate time delay.

Figure 3 shows the curves of rotational speed and inlet guide vane angle varying with time during rapid acceleration and deceleration.

![Figure 3](images/2d7a46680d04e55b998b6b4b9981c306b81f0949f7a48a127bff13f5b3ee163e.jpg)
**Figure 3**

During acceleration at a certain speed, the delay of the servo mechanism can be matched with the lead. It can be seen that, in general, it is impossible to achieve a match between delay and lead for both acceleration and deceleration. During acceleration, matching can only be achieved at a certain speed.

## High-Altitude Compensation

Due to the drop in servo mechanism pressure (i.e., fuel pump pressure), the actuator delay slightly increases as \(P_i\) decreases.

However, this is insufficient to compensate for the increase in engine acceleration time.

The curves in Figure 6 show, at a fixed speed, a comparison between the high-pressure compressor mass flow rate of the engine (which is a measure of acceleration rate for a given excess fuel ratio) and the square root of the pump pressure (which is a measure of actuator delay). It must be noted that the delay of the pressure ratio device itself is independent of changes in \(P_1\), but \(P_1\) will further reduce the sensitivity of the entire system.

By increasing the constant pressure differential across the valve using a spring-loaded valve, the response time of the entire system becomes more sensitive to changes in pump pressure. Although this does not make the system overly sensitive to other random influences, the maximum pressure differential is still insufficient to fully compensate the system.

The solution is to link the spring-loaded servo piston with an air piston. If the pressure ratio changes smoothly (such as during engine acceleration), the position of the air piston will lag behind its position without the spring due to the spring load. Since the air piston without a spring is balanced by the air pressure on the piston, the delay will increase as air pressure decreases.

With this method, matching between any two flight conditions becomes possible.

# 2. System Disadvantages

## Sources of Error

Although we have demonstrated above that, theoretically, the system can be accurately compensated at certain points, errors are still generally present.

Errors are related to the following factors:

1. Manufacturing tolerances of the servo mechanism, actuator, and sensors will cause variations in total delay.
2. Engine characteristic tolerances affect parameter relationships and acceleration rates.
3. Under any given flight condition, matching of delay can generally only be achieved at one specific speed.
4. Only the requirements for two altitudes can be matched.
5. Changes in fuel temperature affect the delay of the servo mechanism.

### Amplification of Errors

It can be demonstrated that although the corrected speed schedule is also not sufficiently precise, the pressure ratio system has a significant disadvantage that the corrected speed system does not.

In the \(N/\sqrt{T}\) schedule, if there is a \(2^\circ\) error in the inlet guide vane position, this error causes a \(2^\circ\) deviation in the inlet guide vane. The same error in the pressure ratio system is significantly amplified due to the shift in compressor characteristics.

For example, during acceleration, at any given moment, a lead error causes the inlet guide vane to produce an excessive negative incidence angle, resulting in insufficient bleed. Both factors shift the characteristics toward the high-speed range. See Figure 4.

Due to the effect of increased compressor pressure ratio, the error is also amplified. For a given speed, within the variable geometry range, the system will balance at a much larger error than that suggested by a simplified mechanical analysis of the system.

The curves in Figure 5 indicate how a system with a delay equal to any given matching delay degree reaches a balanced error.

# Example

To establish the magnitude of relevant quantities, a typical Spey compressor with bleed and inlet guide vane adjustment schedules is taken as an example. The detailed schedule is shown in Figure 7.

![Figure 4](images/884eb06689d996eab694560636de3828d2e97e7b2ff48c7ab253ac8a3078109b.jpg)
**Figure 4**

![Figure 5 Error Characteristics](images/47801f895f7d53448e64853367a0e2c95bb4af27a34d903dbbb23eab8731069d.jpg)
**Figure 5 Error Characteristics**

At constant speed, the compressor characteristics and convergence lines with variable schedule error are shown in Figure 8. For this specific case, it can be seen that an infinitely fast system cannot converge within the range limited by the schedule. Moreover, the graph shows that if the actual delay deviates from the optimal value by 30%, the inlet guide vane error is \(4^\circ\), and the bleed error is 27%.

## Summary

Although the pressure ratio system has the advantage of rapid and accurate measurement of dimensionless parameters, when the engine deviates from the operating line, it may cause unacceptable errors in the \(N/\sqrt{T}\) schedule.

Because under any given condition, it is theoretically impossible to precisely define the magnitude of the error or provide exact limits for allowable error.

However, as pointed out above, the characteristics may be such that a 30% deviation of system delay from the optimal value causes a \(4^\circ\) error in inlet guide vane position and a corresponding bleed error.

As a result of comprehensive consideration, the pressure ratio system was abandoned in favor of a system regulated by corrected speed.

**Note:** At constant speed, when moving from the steady-state operating line to the acceleration control device operating line, the change in \(T_2/T_1\) is not significant. Therefore, it is better to use \(N/\sqrt{T_1}\) to schedule the geometry of the high-pressure compressor.

# 1 Introduction

The following aspects require the \(T_1\) signal:

1. Control of the high-pressure compressor inlet guide vane angle as a function of \(N_H / \sqrt{T}\).
2. Provision of a schedule for \(N_{Fimax}\) varying with \(T_1\).
3. Correction for maximum temperature control.

In all conditions—steady-state and transient—it is desirable for the inlet guide vane angle accuracy to be within \(5^\circ\) of its correct value. Therefore, the delay in the measurement system must be minimized.

To accommodate transient states with continuously varying \(T_1\), a thermocouple must be installed at the sonic throat. This throat should be located in a duct between the compressor inlet and ambient pressure, i.e., the pressure ratio across the throat \(\tau = P_{01}\) (losses neglected). At low pressure ratios, the flow in the throat becomes unchoked. At static conditions, the compressor inlet pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure, causing backflow. The backflow induced by airflow recirculation introduces significant errors. To address this, an ejector system that generates sonic flow at the throat is proposed.

## 2 Thermocouple Requirements (for an Engine Variant)

The thermocouple at the sonic throat must meet the following requirements, where \(T_1\) is the throat total temperature.

### Temperature and Pressure Range

| Temperature \(T_1\) | Pressure (Throat Total Pressure) |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| \(-70^\circ C\) to \(+155^\circ C\) | 2.3 to 33 psia |

### Steady-State Accuracy

Within the specified pressure and temperature ranges: \(\pm 1^\circ C\).

### Transient Accuracy

Assuming \(T_1\) changes at a constant rate of \(5\%/\text{s}\), the measurement error shall not exceed \(5.7\%\).

### Materials

Thermocouple materials with a linear voltage-temperature characteristic are preferred.

## 3 Study of Thermocouple Time Constant

### Introduction

The inlet guide vane schedule must be within \(5^\circ\) of the required position—equivalent to 11.5 units of \(N_H / \sqrt{T_1}\).

Assuming a \(T_1\) rate of change of \(5\%/\text{s}\), to ensure this accuracy, the maximum allowable time constant is 1.14 seconds.

### Analysis

Time constants were estimated for both choked and unchoked throat conditions. For a nickel-chromium vs. nickel-aluminum thermocouple with a diameter of 0.02 inches, the time constant is given by:

\[
\tau = 3.7 P^{-\frac{1}{2}} T_1^{-0.185} M^{-\frac{1}{2}} \left(0.742 + 0.126 M^2\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

When the throat is choked, the time constant simplifies to:

\[
\tau = 3.94 P^{-\frac{1}{2}} T_1^{-0.185}
\]

Using these formulas, the time constant across the flight temperature and pressure range can be determined, as shown in **Figure 1**.

![Figure 1](images/90a1d7dfffce3d5e8cc173c10f994720e352a08262a0daa79d6741218224f4e6.jpg)
**Figure 1** Variation of \(T_1\) thermocouple time constant with venturi total pressure, total temperature, and throat Mach number

It can be shown that the time constant is proportional to:

\[
(D)^{3/2} \quad \text{(Thermocouple wire diameter)}
\]

Thus, the effect of any thermocouple wire diameter can be determined. The magnification factor for estimating the time constant of various wire diameters is shown in **Figure 2**.

![Figure 2](images/5928d8f237ed4488ed19573da062b27131db3a9db5a42b8227a8c4de91108baf.jpg)
**Figure 2** Variation of time constant with thermocouple wire diameter

The time constant magnification factor for a wire diameter of \(D\) inches is:

\[
R = \frac{\text{Time constant for wire diameter } D}{\text{Time constant for 0.02-inch wire}}
\]

Thus, a thermocouple with a diameter of approximately 0.02 inches meets the response requirements.

## 4 Ejector Design (for an Engine Variant)

### Introduction

At static conditions, an ejector is required to provide airflow. Consideration has been given to using \(P_2\) or \(P_3\) air for the ejector.

### Ejector Using \(P_2\) Air

Preliminary studies indicate that this configuration requires more engine airflow than using \(P_3\) air as the primary pressure source.

### Ejector Using \(P_3\) Air

To reduce the required suction pressure, the thermocouple is placed in the throat of a venturi where flow choking occurs at a pressure ratio of 1.1. A review of ejector tests conducted by Rolls-Royce and other organizations covers the pressure ratio range required for this application. Thus, the measured results can be used for theoretical analysis.

For the required primary ejector pressure ratio \(P_3 / P_0\), the ejector size is determined based on a pressure ratio \(P_3 / P_0 = 16:1\) to achieve flow choking in the venturi. This pressure ratio corresponds approximately to the sea-level static maximum speed condition.

Across the entire operating range of the inlet guide vanes for \(N/\sqrt{T}\), although the venturi does not choke at aircraft static conditions, the throat Mach number remains high. Under these conditions, since \(T_1\) variations are small, even if \(M_N = 1.0\), the thermocouple does not require rapid response.

### Ejector Details (Figure 3)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Primary nozzle diameter | 0.091 in |
| Mixing section diameter | 0.55 in |
| Mixing section length | 2.75 in |
| Diffuser angle | \(6^\circ\) |
| Diffuser length | 2.1 in |
| Discharge pipe diameter | 0.77 in |
| Maximum primary ejector airflow | 0.042 lb/s (at \(340^\circ C\)) |

![Figure 3](images/c3cdd09a9e35064b258cd43cbf4b87f68e4687133d49d40fdd4f75d7e918f086.jpg)
**Figure 3** Ejector

Six venturis are connected to a manifold branching from the compressor inlet. The outlets of each venturi are connected to a manifold communicating with the ejector airflow outlets.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Bleed manifold diameter (from compressor inlet) | 0.569 in |
| Individual venturi inlet pipe diameter | 0.23 in |
| Venturi throat diameter | 0.10 in |
| Venturi outlet diameter | 0.13 in |
| Venturi diffuser length | 0.43 in |
| Outlet pipe diameter | 0.29 in |
| Ejector manifold diameter | 0.71 in |

For the above ejector, at sea-level static maximum speed, the effect of bleed air (0.04% of high-pressure compressor mass flow) reduces engine thrust by 0.025%.

## Future Work

The following work is underway:

1. Performance of the device across various flight conditions.
2. Influence of secondary time constants of the thermocouple.

| Spey MK202 | Green |
| Interim Statement on \(T_1\) Thermocouple and Ejector System Performance | |

**First Edition, March 25, 1965**

### Purpose

To review the performance status of the \(T_1\) sonic thermocouple and propose methods for further improvement.

## 1 Discussion

It is recommended that the Spey MK202 engine use the existing \(T_1\) sonic thermocouple device and its associated ejector.

Across the entire operating range of the inlet guide vanes and bleed valves, a sonic airflow must pass over the thermocouple to generate a calibratable signal without \(T_1\) error. This airflow is provided by the ejector. Currently, to ensure choked flow at the thermocouple, the existing ejector requires a minimum primary ejector nozzle pressure ratio of approximately 8:1. This pressure ratio is higher than anticipated because the venturi in the Sangamo sonic thermocouple device did not perform as expected (see Section 2).

The most critical condition occurs at low \(N/\sqrt{T_1}\), sea-level static, at the beginning of the inlet guide vane operating range. Under this condition, using \(P_3\) air, the available primary ejector pressure ratio of the existing device is only about 4.5:1.

On the Spey MK202, the pressure ratio at the start of the inlet guide vane operating range depends on whether \(P_3\) or 7th-stage high-pressure air is used. Early studies recommended using 7th-stage air, but in this case, even the maximum \(P_3\) pressure is insufficient. Therefore, on the Spey MK202, \(P_3\) air is used to minimize \(T_1\) errors caused by unchoked venturi flow. This problem is further exacerbated because most \(P_3\) air is bled from the anti-icing manifold. When anti-icing air flows at full capacity, the pressure loss in the anti-icing manifold reduces the available ejector pressure ratio from 4.7:1 to less than 4:1.

Thus, it is desirable to improve the device so that the sonic thermocouple maintains choked flow even when the maximum primary ejector pressure ratio drops to 4:1.

## 2 Reasons for High Pressure Requirements

Because the thermocouple venturi did not perform as expected, the required primary ejector pressure ratio is higher than anticipated. The thermocouple venturi achieves choking at a pressure ratio of approximately 1.25:1, but when the thermocouple is installed in the venturi and the device is mounted with two \(90^\circ\) fittings, the venturi choking pressure ratio increases to 2:1, and the choked mass flow rate...

The reduction is approximately **20%**, as shown in **Figure 1**.

![Figure 1](images/bab199d787ff625e9e08bac2dcfe3e013463de1a4bcfc50df62f11af88d77745.jpg)
**Figure 1** Characteristics of a three-element Venturi thermocouple

When comparing the actual characteristics of a Venturi assembly with thermocouple wires to those of a simple orifice (Q-curve corresponding to \( \mathrm{M} \sqrt{\mathrm{T}} / \mathrm{P} = 0.0074 \), see **Figure 2**), a high degree of consistency is observed. This allows us to conclude that the difference in characteristics between Venturi tubes with and without thermocouple wires is primarily due to flow separation caused by the presence of the thermocouple in the Venturi throat. Some results may be influenced by disturbances and vortices at the Venturi inlet, but this effect is likely minor and difficult to estimate.

Flow separation in the Venturi throat has two effects:

1. It reduces pressure recovery in the Venturi diffuser, thereby increasing the choking pressure ratio to a value close to that of a plain orifice. The pumping action of the ejector is significantly affected, and the secondary flow pressure ratio required to pump the same secondary mass flow increases from **1.25** to **1.9**.

2. It reduces the flow coefficient, an effect that is inherently minor but clearly related to the above (1).

If the Venturi functions satisfactorily, then when the primary ejector pressure ratio is **4:1**, the Venturi pressure ratio of **1.25:1** will cause choking.

### 3. Possible Improvement Methods

Considering the optimization of the primary ejector nozzle size and position may improve ejector performance. This would inevitably lead to some improvements in the Sangamo thermocouple assembly.

By reviewing current ejector performance and comparing it with past experience, it is found that reducing the secondary airflow can significantly improve the performance of this sonic thermocouple. Reducing the number of thermocouples (and thus the number of Venturi tubes) from **3** to **2** is easily achievable. While the effect is not as significant as perfecting the Venturi tube itself, it remains valuable.

To verify performance, an orifice plate with an effective area of **0.0187 in²** was used in place of the Sangamo tube for testing. Ejector characteristic tests were conducted for **2/3** of each orifice restrictor.

![Figure 2](images/56206201174b6dbe42c23ffb0d59ce1499045e19fb7f08954375c29f6aa94e8e.jpg)
**Figure 2** Comparison of characteristics between a three-element Venturi assembly (with thermocouple wires) and a simple orifice restrictor
**First Edition, May 21, 1965**

Assuming \( \mathrm{C_d} = 0.74 \) as a first estimate, the diameters of the two orifice plates are **0.18 inches** and **0.147 inches**, respectively.

It must be noted that if reducing the number of thermocouples from **3** to **2** results in significant improvement, then the size and position of the primary ejector nozzle must be re-examined to achieve a new optimal configuration. For example, if a smaller secondary flow is required, a larger primary ejector nozzle can be installed.

During this test, a Sangamo tube equipped with Venturi components but without thermocouple wires was also tested to verify whether the primary influence is the small airflow passage at the Venturi inlet or, as suspected, the presence of the thermocouple wires.

| Spey MK202 T Thermocouple and Inlet Guide Vane System Error |

## Abstract

The "Initial Technical Requirements" specify the technical requirements for each device in the inlet guide vane system, including the maximum allowable error for each device. Based on these allowable errors, the overall maximum possible error of the entire inlet guide vane system was estimated.

The maximum error expressed in \( \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \) is:

- At \( \mathrm{T_1} = 203 \, \mathrm{K} \): \( \pm 13 \, \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \)
- At \( \mathrm{T_1} = 288 \, \mathrm{K} \): \( \pm 9 \, \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \) (steady state)
- At \( \mathrm{T_1} = 480 \, \mathrm{K} \): \( \pm 5 \, \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \)
- At \( \mathrm{T_1} = 347 \, \mathrm{K} \): \( -16 \, \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \) (transient state)

## Introduction

The errors in the \( \mathrm{T_1} \) signal used in the \( \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \) device were estimated based on the individual errors of each component.

**Steady-state errors:**

| Component                | Error                     |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Thermocouple             | \( \pm 3.5 \, \mathrm{°C} \) |
| Position feedback device | \( \pm 2.25 \, \mathrm{°C} \) |
| Amplifier                | \( \pm 1\% \)             |
| Linkage device           | \( \pm 0.5 \, \mathrm{°C} \) |
| **Total maximum possible error** | \( \pm 7.25 \, \mathrm{°C} \) |

The corresponding error expressed in \( \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \) is:

| \( \mathrm{T_1} \) Thermocouple (K) | 203 | 288 | 480 |
|------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|
| \( \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \) Maximum Error | 13  | 9   | 5   |

**Transient-state errors:**

At \( \mathrm{T_1} = 347 \, \mathrm{K} \), the thermocouple response is \( 9.9 \, \mathrm{°C} \). After the transient change in \( \mathrm{T_1} \) ends, the maximum possible error is:

\[
\text{Total maximum error} = (9.9 + 7.25) \, \mathrm{°C}
\]

The corresponding \( \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \) error is **16**.

# Section Nine

| Technical Design Report | TDR4147 |
|-------------------------|---------|
| Estimation of Allowable Inlet Temperature Variation Rate for Spey MK202 |

**First Edition, October 20, 1965**

## Abstract

To ensure satisfactory performance of the inlet guide vane and bleed valve control system, this report estimates the allowable variation rate of \( \mathrm{T_1} \).

During certain maneuvers, \( \mathrm{T_1} \) variation rates as high as **5°C/second** (increase or decrease) may be encountered (see Section 3 of this report).

Under flight conditions where high \( \mathrm{T_1} \) decay rates may occur, the estimation shows that the control system can tolerate a variation rate of up to **12% per second** without encountering choking, stall, or flutter issues.

In the absence of test data, to determine the allowable deviation of the inlet guide vanes from the nominal schedule without causing compressor surge, the range of \( \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \) deviation from the nominal value under conditions where \( \mathrm{T_1} \) may vary significantly is estimated to be **-10 to -50 \( \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \)** (see table on page 424). Only after determining the allowable deviation from the nominal control schedule can the allowable \( \mathrm{T_1} \) increase rate be assessed. Phase-lead circuits must be incorporated into the \( \mathrm{T_1} \) sensing system to ensure the system can respond to a \( \mathrm{T_1} \) variation rate of **5°C/second**, so that the maximum allowable deviation of \( \mathrm{N_H} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \) is less than **20**. With a circuit time constant of **1 second**, a \( \mathrm{T_1} \) increase rate of **5°C/second** and an inlet guide vane schedule limit of **-15 \( \mathrm{N_H} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \)** are permissible.

It must be noted that at \( \mathrm{T_1} = 200 \, \mathrm{K} \), if the tolerances of all components in the \( \mathrm{T_1} \) system are assumed to be at their maximum specified values, the total error may exceed the allowable deviation of **-10 \( \mathrm{N_H} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \)** from the nominal control schedule, potentially causing surge even under normal steady-state \( \mathrm{T_1} \) conditions. However, if no surge occurs, a deviation of **-13 \( \mathrm{N_H} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \)** is still considered acceptable.

## 1. Introduction

The customer has indicated that the \( \mathrm{T_1} \) variation rate may exceed **1.1% per second**. During certain maneuvers, \( \mathrm{T_1} \) variation rates of up to **5°C/second** may be experienced. For example:

1. \( \mathrm{T_1} \) increase: From **50,000 feet, \( \mathrm{M_N} = 1.8 \)** diving to **43,000 feet, \( \mathrm{M_N} = 2.0 \)**.
2. \( \mathrm{T_1} \) decrease: During a rapid throttle reduction at \( \mathrm{M_N} = 2.0 \).

During \( \mathrm{T_1} \) changes, the time constant of the thermocouple causes the \( \mathrm{T_1} \) signal input to the inlet guide vane scheduling device to lag behind the actual \( \mathrm{T_1} \), resulting in an incorrect inlet guide vane and bleed valve schedule. This error is in addition to the steady-state error, which arises from manufacturing tolerances in the thermocouple and amplifier, as well as adjustment limitations in the \( \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \) device on the test rig.

This report estimates the allowable \( \mathrm{T_1} \) variation rate for the inlet guide vane scheduling device that will not cause compressor surge or choking stall flutter.

## 2. Data

### 2.1 High-Pressure Compressor Inlet Guide Vane Schedule

The nominal inlet guide vane schedule is set to a **40°** angle at \( \mathrm{N_H} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} = 595 \) and a **0°** angle at \( \mathrm{N_{J3}} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} = 695 \).

**Note:** The original schedule corresponded to **592** and **655**. This change is due to the adoption of \( \mathrm{T_2 / T_1} \) measurements and the expression of the control schedule in terms of \( \mathrm{N_{HP}} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_2}} \), as the original schedule data could not meet the requirements.

### 2.2 Deviation from Nominal Schedule

Previous research expressed the allowable deviation relative to the nominal schedule in terms of \( \mathrm{T_1} \) signal error, as follows:

At \( \mathrm{T_1} = 200 \, \mathrm{K} \), the corresponding \( \mathrm{T_1} \) limit values are **-18°C** and **+6.2°C**. In states where \( \mathrm{T_1} \) decreases, the \( \mathrm{T_1} \) signal delay should not exceed **18%**, while during \( \mathrm{T_1} \) increases, the delay should not exceed **6.2%**.

At \( \mathrm{T_1} = 335 \, \mathrm{K} \) (\( \mathrm{M_N} = 2.0 \), **50,000 feet, cold day**), the corresponding values become **-30°C** and **+10.4°C**.

These figures are based on current allowable deviations provided by the compressor and development departments to prevent compressor choking and surge. Specifically, **1.031** is based on an allowable deviation of **-10 \( \mathrm{N_H} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \)**. To determine the actual deviation from the nominal schedule and subsequently assess the dispersion of this deviation, some test data are required. The extreme values considered in this report reach **-50 \( \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \)**.

### 2.3 \( \mathrm{T_1} \) Measurement System Tolerances

1. **Allowable Manufacturing Tolerances:**
   - Thermocouple and connecting wires: \( \pm 3 \, \mathrm{°C} \)
   - Amplifier: \( \pm 1 \, \mathrm{°C} \)
   - Position feedback device: \( \pm 2.25 \, \mathrm{°C} \)
   - Linkage device: \( \pm 0.5 \, \mathrm{°C} \)

2. **Test Rig Adjustment Range:**
   - At an inlet guide vane angle of **40°**, for most \( \mathrm{T_1} \) operating ranges, the maximum tolerance for adjusting the \( \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \) device on the test rig corresponds to approximately **4°C**.

These adjustment limits include errors from the position feedback and linkage devices. Therefore, considering the amplifier and thermocouple errors, the maximum possible error is \( \pm 8 \, \mathrm{°C} \).

It can be seen that this exceeds the **+6.2%** error given in Section 2.2 for \( \mathrm{T_1} = 200 \, \mathrm{K} \). This implies that even if the maximum allowable deviation of the inlet guide vane schedule from the nominal schedule does not exceed **-10 \( \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{T_1}} \)**, surge may still occur under steady-state \( \mathrm{T_1} \) conditions.

### 2.4 Sonic Thermocouple Time Constant

The transfer function of the sonic thermocouple can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{1 + \mathrm{aD}}{(1 + \mathrm{R_1 D})(1 + \mathrm{R_2 D})}
\]

where the values of **a**, \( \mathrm{R_1} \), and \( \mathrm{R_2} \) depend on the inlet total pressure \( \mathrm{P_1} \).

## 3. Analysis

### 3.1 \( \mathrm{T_1} \) Decrease

As indicated by the customer (see Introduction), high \( \mathrm{T_1} \) decay rates can occur during rapid deceleration at high \( \mathrm{M_N} \), such as when throttling back sharply. For the study of the inlet guide vane control system, the throttle is only reduced to the idle position under consideration, and the engine is not shut down. Above **50,000 feet**, the difference between maximum and idle states is minimal, so it is not considered when analyzing high \( \mathrm{T_1} \) decay rates.

The maximum thermocouple time constant occurs at low \( \mathrm{P_1} \) values. Therefore, the state at **50,000 feet, \( \mathrm{M_N} = 2.0 \)** is studied, where the thermocouple time constants are \( \mathrm{R_1} = 0.66 \, \mathrm{s} \), \( \mathrm{R_2} = 17.9 \, \mathrm{s} \), \( \mathrm{a} = 16.75 \, \mathrm{s} \), and \( \mathrm{T_1} = 335 \, \mathrm{K} \).

From Section 2.2, the maximum allowable deviation for \( \mathrm{T_1} \) decrease is **30.0°C**. From Section 2.3, the maximum steady-state error is **8.0°C**. Therefore, the maximum allowable delay in a transient state is:

\[
\varepsilon_{\mathrm{max}} = 22.0 \, \mathrm{°C}
\]

Under a constant \( \mathrm{T_1} \) variation rate of \( \mathbf{x} \, \mathrm{°C/s} \), the delay is given by:

\[
\varepsilon = (\mathrm{R_1} + \mathrm{R_2} - \mathrm{a}) \mathbf{x}
\]

### Translation

Thus, for this condition, the maximum permissible rate of change (**X<sub>max</sub>**) is **12.1 °C/second**.

#### 3.2 **T<sub>1</sub> Increase**

Under the same condition, high **T<sub>1</sub>** rates of change occur during high-Mach-number flight. During a dive, altitude decreases and ambient temperature increases.

Therefore, for **M<sub>N</sub> = 2.0**, when diving from 70,000 feet to 43,000 feet (below 43,000 feet, due to high **R<sub>1</sub>**, the thermocouple response characteristics tend to remain constant), the permissible **T<sub>1</sub>** rate of change is estimated using a method similar to that in Section 3.1.

As described in Section 2.2, assuming the tolerance range for deviation from the nominal inlet guide vane (IGV) scheduling is **-10 N/√T<sub>1</sub>** to **-50 N/√T<sub>1</sub>**, the **T<sub>1</sub>** rate of change was estimated. The results are shown in the table below.

### 4. Discussion

The estimation in Section 3.1 indicates that under conditions with a large **T<sub>1</sub>** decrease rate, the **T<sub>1</sub>** measurement system's response permits a rate of decrease on the order of **5 °C/second**.

As noted in Section 2.3, when the inlet guide vanes deviate from the nominal scheduling by the permissible limit of **-10 N/√T<sub>1</sub>** and all components of the **T<sub>1</sub>** measurement system operate at their specified maximum errors, when **T<sub>1</sub> = 200 K**, the total error will exceed the permissible value, which is unacceptable for **T<sub>1</sub>** transient processes.

Furthermore, from the table above, under high **T<sub>1</sub>** rate-of-change conditions, a deviation of **-20 N/√T<sub>1</sub>** from the nominal inlet guide vane scheduling is required to reach a **T<sub>1</sub>** rate of change of **5 °C/second**, i.e., twice the current tolerance.

By introducing certain phase-lead circuits in the amplifier, if further testing shows that the safe deviation from the nominal scheduling is less than **20 N/√T<sub>1</sub>**, the control system can be improved to some extent. This would allow an increase in the permissible **T<sub>1</sub>** rate of change in all conditions, including **T<sub>1</sub>** decrease states. For example, a phase-lead circuit with a time constant of 1 second, when used for a constant-slope input, allows the **T<sub>1</sub>** increase rate to reach **5 °C/second**, while the permissible deviation of the inlet guide vanes from the nominal scheduling is **-15 N<sub>H</sub>/√T<sub>1</sub>**.

**Note:** When considering the maximum total tolerance, this report uses the arithmetic sum of individual tolerances. However, for approval at guarantee points, the normal practice is to take the root mean square (RMS) of individual errors to determine the maximum total error (when considering instrument errors, etc.).

In this application, the total steady-state error is **±5.1 °C**, rather than the **±8%** obtained by arithmetic summation. The result of this change is that a **T<sub>1</sub>** increase rate of **5 °C/second** is permitted, and for such a **T<sub>1</sub>** increase rate, the maximum permissible deviation of the inlet guide vanes from the nominal schedule is **-16.5 N<sub>H</sub>/√T<sub>1</sub>** (without phase-lead circuit) and **-12 N<sub>H</sub>/√T<sub>1</sub>** (with phase-lead circuit).

| Estimation of Inlet Temperature Rate-of-Change Limits to Prevent High-Pressure Compressor Surge in the Spey MK202 | |

**First Edition**
**22 December 1965**

### Abstract

An estimation was made of the maximum rate of change of inlet temperature **T<sub>1</sub>** suitable for continuous operation and the time limits for higher rates of change. The curves in Figure 1 provide:

1. The estimated maximum permissible continuous rate of change and time limits for higher rates of change to prevent compressor surge. The maximum permissible deviation from the nominal scheduling of the inlet guide vanes and bleed valves is **-20 N<sub>H</sub>/√T<sub>1</sub>**. This value is derived from high-pressure compressor test data and the most severe inlet distortion.
2. For comparison, assuming the currently adopted value of **1.1 °C/second** as the specified higher rate of change, the corresponding time limit just permits continuous operation.

This report supplements TDR 4147, which provides extensive data on this research topic. As noted in TDR 4147, the **T<sub>1</sub>** rates of change cited in this report are also applicable for preventing compressor choke, stall, and flutter.

---

### 1. Data

#### 1.1 Maximum Tolerance for Deviation from Nominal Scheduling of Inlet Guide Vanes and Bleed Valves to Prevent High-Pressure Compressor Surge

Based on rig tests with the worst inlet pressure distortion, the Compressor Development Department's estimation indicates that the deviation from the nominal scheduling should not exceed **-20 N<sub>H</sub>/√T<sub>10</sub>**. Under given conditions, considering the variation in **T<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>1</sub>**, this report uses a maximum deviation of **-20 N<sub>H</sub>/√T<sub>1</sub>**.

#### 1.2 Permissible Error in **T<sub>1</sub>** Signal in **N<sub>H</sub>/√T<sub>1</sub>** Scheduling Device

In TDR 4147, after considering the maximum instrument error and adjustment limits of the **N<sub>H</sub>/√T<sub>1</sub>** device, a deviation of **-20 N<sub>H</sub>/√T<sub>1</sub>** from the nominal scheduling was found to correspond to a **T<sub>1</sub>** signal error of **15.4 °C** in the **N<sub>H</sub>/√T<sub>1</sub>** device.

#### 1.3 Device Time Constants

The thermocouple time constant is the same as that used in TDR 4147.

In addition, the following time constants were used in the analysis:

- **T<sub>1</sub>** carriage in the **N/√T<sub>1</sub>** device: **1.15 seconds**
- Amplifier: **0.02 seconds**

---

### 2. Analysis

For various constant-slope inputs to the **T<sub>1</sub>** thermocouple, the signal delay in the **N/√T<sub>1</sub>** device was estimated as it increased over time to the final steady-state error.

From these estimations, the following data were obtained:

1. The steady-state error produced by the maximum constant-slope input is less than **15.4 °C**.
2. For constant-slope inputs, the time required to reach a **15.4 °C** delay is greater than the above value.

Additionally, the following data were obtained:

Assuming a continuous rate of change of **1.1 °C/second** as the current requirement, the time limits for higher rates of change can be derived.

The results are shown in **Figure 1**.

### Part Eleven

## **Spey MK202 Engine Inlet Sensing Assembly Initial Technical Requirements – 10 March 1965**

### 1.1 Description of Technical Requirements

An electrical signal representing the inlet temperature rate **T<sub>1</sub>** must be provided to the engine control amplifier. For this purpose, a device consisting of three thermocouple junctions connected in parallel is required. When **T<sub>1</sub>** changes, the measurement system delay must be minimized to meet transient-state requirements. Each thermocouple junction must be placed at the throat of a sonic orifice. The entire assembly is installed in a duct through which engine inlet air is induced to flow by an ejector. Since the compressor inlet is at low pressure in static conditions, this ejector is necessary to prevent backflow.

### 1.2 Temperature and Pressure

The ranges of inlet temperature and total pressure during engine operation are as follows:

1. Temperature: **-77 °C to +207 °C**
2. Sonic orifice throat pressure: **1.5 to 35 psi (absolute)**

### 1.3 Accuracy

The entire thermocouple assembly and connecting leads, within the temperature range of **-77 °C to +207 °C**, must not deviate from the tabulated values by more than **±0.12 millivolts**. This is related to the selection and stockpiling of the thermocouple materials (Nickel-Chromium/Nickel-Aluminum alloy batches).

### Part Twelve

## **Spey MK202 Servo Motor and Tachogenerator Initial Technical Requirements – 5 July 1966**

### 1.1 System Description

The amplifier receives a signal from the engine inlet thermocouple, which is appropriately amplified to drive the servo motor. The motor output shaft rotates to provide inlet guide vane and bleed valve control system movement according to the inlet temperature schedule.

The motor output shaft also actuates a position feedback device, which outputs a signal back to the amplifier. When this signal equals the thermocouple signal, the amplifier has no output, and the servo motor output shaft stops rotating, maintaining the inlet temperature schedule. The amplifier's speed feedback signal is provided by a tachogenerator mounted on the servo motor to prevent overshoot of the motor output shaft position.

### 1.2 Device Description

The servo motor and tachogenerator form a complete assembly. The relative position of the servo motor output shaft must be directly proportional to the engine inlet total temperature. When voltage is applied to the motor by the amplifier, the motor must rotate, with the direction of rotation determined by the phase angle.

The tachogenerator is a **400 Hz** induction type.

- At **20 °C** and **1000 rpm**, the output is **3 ± 0.5 V (RMS)**.
- At **20 °C**, the maximum residual voltage is **25 mV**.
- At **20 °C** and **3000 rpm**, the phase shift from the reference phase is **10°**.
- Over the entire range of environmental conditions, the maximum permissible output variation is **0.3%/°C**.
- Residual voltage variation over the entire range of environmental conditions is negligible.
- At **20 °C** and a torque load of **50 g·cm**, the starting voltage is **30% lower** than the control voltage.

### 1.3 Power Supply Voltage

1. **Tachogenerator:**
   - Excitation voltage: **115 V, 400 Hz, single-phase AC**.

2. **Servo Motor:**
   - Reference voltage: **115 V, 400 Hz, single-phase AC**.
   - Control winding voltage: **13–0–13 V AC**, with a **90° phase difference** from the reference winding.
   - Maximum locked-rotor current:
     - Reference winding: **200 mA**
     - Control winding: **840 mA**

### 1.4 Maximum Starting Torque

In the locked-rotor condition, the servo motor requires a maximum starting torque of **172 g·cm**.

### 1.5 Rotor Travel

From start to stop, the rotor shaft's full travel is **16 turns**, and the motor can maintain full power in a prolonged locked-rotor condition.

### 1.6 Environment

The device is installed on the engine and is fully immersed in engine fuel (with the possibility of internal oil immersion). The fuel temperature range is:

- **-40 °C to +100 °C** (device operating)
- **-70 °C to -40 °C** and **+100 °C to +150 °C** (device not operating)

Maximum fuel pressure: **260 psi (gauge)** (relief valve pressure).

The device is suitable for operation in the following fuels:

- **AVTUR** (Jet A-1)
- **AVTAG** (JP-4)
- **AVCAT** (JP-5)

The above fuels may or may not contain **0.10–0.15% (by volume)** antifreeze additive.

### 1.7 Fuel Contamination

When using the generally contaminated fuel specified in Section 1.6, the device must operate satisfactorily. Durability testing may be revised as needed to comply with test standards agreed upon by Rolls-Royce and the customer based on specific usage conditions.

### Part Thirteen

## **Spey MK202 Position Feedback Device Initial Technical Requirements – 14 June 1966**

### 1.1 Function of the Device

The position feedback device is part of the engine inlet guide vane and bleed valve control system, which schedules based on the engine inlet temperature **T<sub>1</sub>**. Its function is to generate an electrical signal whose voltage is a function of angular displacement. When this signal is fed back to the amplifier and balances the signal from the thermocouple, the actuator motor stops rotating.

### 1.2 Displacement

(1) This device has an angular displacement.

(2) The maximum travel on each side of the nominal zero point is **14°52′** (i.e., total travel is **29°44′**).

### 1.3 Output

Figure 1 illustrates the required "effective" characteristics of this device. The entire travel range is linear. When the specified reference voltage is **3 V ± 5% (RMS)**, the feedback and output winding impedance is **12 kΩ**, and the ambient temperature is **22°C ± 0°C**, the design center of the output characteristic slope is **0.112 V/V (reference)/degree (mechanical) ± 5%**.

![Figure 1](images/d66662a4382ca3d53edb263c933d068e5d44fd4cba30936f2bb097730d4c7f7e.jpg)
**Figure 1** Nominal effective characteristics with accuracy limits for the control system

Under all permissible conditions in this specification, the excitation winding voltage shall not exceed **20 V (RMS)**.

The accuracy range, shown by dashed lines, represents the allowable variation from the nominal curve: **±15′** within **±12½°**, and **±18′** between **±12½°** and **14°52′**. This applies to any combination of ambient temperature from **+100°C to -26°C** and permissible power supply or impedance conditions in this specification. Between **-26°C and -54°C**, the allowable tolerance increases proportionally, reaching **±30′** at **-54°C**.

Throughout its service life, all devices must remain within the accuracy limits relative to the nominal slope.

For linkage mechanisms in the control device, a **±5%** slope variation between devices can be accommodated by adjustment to meet the performance shown in Figure 1.

The slope variation is illustrated in Figure 2. The performance of any specific device may lie on or within any pair of accuracy limit lines corresponding to a nominal characteristic line in Figure 2. The pair of accuracy limit lines associated with any device shall be defined such that the system can be internally adjusted to conform to the nominal characteristic limits shown in Figure 1. When the linkage mechanism is adjusted based on its characteristic slope variation, its accuracy limits shall still remain within the range shown in Figure 1.

### 1.4 System Impedance

**Figure 2** Allowable variation of nominal characteristic slope

The output and feedback winding load resistance is **12 kΩ ± 10%**, and may be shunted by a **0.005 μF** capacitor.

For an adjusted sensor, to achieve a feedback winding voltage of **3 V (RMS)**, the maximum excitation voltage must be less than or equal to **20 V (RMS)**, applied to an impedance of approximately **(330 + 740j) Ω ± 20%**.

The output winding impedance is **(280 + 900j) Ω ± 20%**, and the feedback winding impedance is **(60 + 30j) Ω ± 20%**.

### 1.5 Power Supply

The device is powered by a **400 Hz ± 5%** power supply.

### 1.6 Environment

The device is installed on the engine and is fully immersed in engine fuel (thus, internal oil immersion is possible). The fuel temperature range is as follows:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Maximum fuel pressure | 260 psi (gauge) (thermal relief valve pressure) |

The device is suitable for operation with the following fuels:

- AVTUR JP.1
- AVTAG JP.4
- AVCAT JP.5

The fuel may or may not contain **0.1% to 0.15% (by volume)** anti-icing additive.

### 1.7 System Compensation

The feedback device includes a temperature-compensated feedback winding. The excitation voltage is derived from a feedback amplifier that maintains a constant output from the feedback winding.

### Section 14

**Initial Technical Requirements for Spey MK202 Inlet Guide Vane and Bleed Valve Control Amplifier – 13 October 1966**

### 1.1 Circuit Description

The device includes a circuit that adjusts the inlet guide vanes and bleed valve via an actuator motor based on engine inlet temperature.

### 1.2 Inlet Guide Vane and Bleed Valve Operation

#### 1.2.1 Requirements

(a) The inlet guide vane and bleed valve circuit amplifies the **T₁** thermocouple signal from the engine inlet and provides power to the servo motor, such that the output shaft rotation position is proportional to the engine inlet total temperature. The output shaft is directly connected to an angular displacement sensor, meeting the scheduled requirements of the inlet guide vane and bleed valve system based on inlet temperature.

(b) If **T₁** increases, the motor rotates clockwise (viewed from the output shaft), causing the angular position sensor to rotate counterclockwise (viewed from the shaft). The gear ratio between the motor and sensor is approximately **730:1**.

#### 1.2.2 Inlet Temperature Range
